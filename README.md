- Increased XP gain from monsters
- Reduced perk cost multiplier
- Reworked healing, potions are more common but cheaper
- More Quests/Maps
- New materials/runes/potions/monsters/blueprints

And more!

*This mod includes HD Lands*
*Requires EIStarter, which is provided on this repo, but it can also be found on `gipat.ru`*

We value feedback! If you have any comments to make please open an Issue on this repo.

# Installation

- Download this repo (using `git` is recommended)
- Install the Evil Islands Addon, located in `/tools/eistarter-1046-en.exe` (skip if you already have it installed)
- Copy (or make a junction/symlink) the `Universal-Mod` directory into the  `<EIStarter Path>/Mods` directory

Extra step for running on Linux with WINE :
*WINE requires a DLL override to run EIStarter properly, otherwise the injection will fail and the game will launch in vanilla.*
You need to use the following environment variable : `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput=n,b"`

# Disclaimer

- We __do not__ own any of the tools used *except* the scripts in __eimultitool__, the binaries used are community tools.
- Some files included in `./resources/reference-assets` come from the vanilla game, some others come from other mods.
