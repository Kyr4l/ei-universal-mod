Where is the young Joon man?

Danger. Fear. Horror. Red skin - horror comes. Horror must be cheated. No more young man.

Is he dead?!

He is not among dead. Not among living. He is not anywhere. There is another one, another face, another skin. The other - no horror. Red skin - horror comes.

What is the horror? Why did it come?
#ANIMATION 15

#phrase Spirit  8
Horror kills. Horror came after Joon. The young man became someone else, the young man went somewhere through nowhere. Horror killed me, killed everyone. Then left. Let me go, live man, you torture me.

It is more difficult to communicate with spirits than it is to listen to market gossip, young man! But today I anticipate Taivo's fall from grace with joy, so I will descend to your intelligence level and explain what you just heard.

Something came into the scientists' mansion to destroy the young Joon man. To ward it off, the young man was transformed into another person and teleported somewhere. The teleport spell takes time, so the young man must have used an object infused with the spell.

So if you want to find him, find that object or its shreds in the ruins of the mansion. A good Magician can tell from the shreds where the teleport has been directed.

A good Magician? I wonder if the old Necromancer in the Last Shelter could be considered as one? Anyway, I should try to find the amulet and talk to Kehel about it!
