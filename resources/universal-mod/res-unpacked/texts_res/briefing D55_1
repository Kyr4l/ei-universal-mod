When you thought I was a Brigand you said you would call the Lords of the Dungeons for help. Did you mean Wormheads? Can you really control those horrible creatures?

No, I cannot give them orders... Wormheads simply respect the treaty they have made with the Joons in ancient times. The decline of our race, the disaster which fell upon the world - the Lords of the Dungeons do not care about all that. They simply keep their word.

That is why I was able to escape from the Brigands' subterranean camp without pursuit... they were scared! So I was surprised and scared when you came in here, even though I was not alone.

It was not easy. And by the way, I hope you know how we can get out of this cave? A teleport spell will take us back to Tka-Rick, but it will only work for the two of us. What about the one who remains here?

Oh, that is easy. The Lords of the Dungeons know by now that all my visitors are trustworthy.

Excellent! Now could you give me a few minutes? I have to say goodbye...
