Because Redhead was killed, the Free Hunters were very upset with you, Chosen, but I managed to explain to them that you acted with the best of intentions. So to show their good will, they told us that the Goblins are planning another raid. We agreed that the Free Hunters and Gort's soldiers would strike the Goblins first. I would appreciate it were the Chosen to take part in that enterprise too.

Will anyone ever ask me what I would like to do? But all right, I could do that - Goblins do not worry me unduly.

Wonderful! The Goblins gather as we speak at the western edge of the swamps, near the river hillocks. But first you will need to see the Chieftain's lieutenant. He will wait for you where the road to the river begins.

Of course! And unarmed! Others will cover the approaches to the meeting point. You are perhaps aware that these are cruel lands, so the men will use utmost caution. When you arrive at the meeting point, there will be a nice little party!

But do not tell Babur about it. You may be friends with him but do remember that he would do anything for money!

I do not like the smell of this... I can even pinpoint what is wrong... The Brigands were too quick to forgive me! On the other hand, perchance the Elder really did come to an agreement with them? His words could sweeten the breath of a horned toad!

It is as clear as mud, as they say. So I should watch my step!
