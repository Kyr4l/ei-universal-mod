Items shop
The scrollable lists at the top and bottom of the screen show what items are available in the shop and in your inventory. Use the buttons on the left and right sides of the lists to sort the items. The "shop counter" is located at the center of the screen. In the lower left part of the screen you can see the total cost of transaction. Use the adjacent buttons to confirm or cancel transaction (if you cancel, all items will be returned).
