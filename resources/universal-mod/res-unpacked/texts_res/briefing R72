So you came back alone. The Dragonet saw what happened to you in Khadagan, but he is too young to understand the meaning of events. So - I await a full explanation!

Oh great Tka-Rik! You expected to see your fellow Joon, while I waited for my lover... so tell me who is closer to despair now? But l still beg you not to be angry with this man. He may have failed in his quest, but he barely avoided death! Is that not worthy of respect - at the very least?

Fair enough, Lu-a... I am afraid that I allowed my disappointment to turn into anger. I regret that, Zak, and I ask you to forgive me. But please, tell me what happened?

I am afraid I will have to disappoint you! At-Zako is not in Khadagan, he used a teleportation amulet. I do not think a Great Magician would find it hard to find out where the amulet took him? But we also have yet another problem.

The man has been subjected to a transformation spell, so no one knows what he looks like now! Frankly, I have no idea how I can find him!

This is indeed sad news to me... but you said you would continue your quest? I have seen how many times you have been close to death... I cannot ask you to take yet more risks.

I will be frank with you: if it was only myself, I would forget about the whole thing. But to see the sadness in Lu-a-Jalla's eyes... I realize that when she sees At-Zako she will in her joy... forget about everything including me! But I still want to achieve it for her!

No, I will not forget you, I can promise you that. You are strong, you are brave, you saved me and asked nothing in return - how could I ever forget that?

You know what I mean... Oh, but enough of that!
