Oh dear, I wonder where those green monsters learned to read and write! Not only their language is awful, they cannot even spell it... But we are lucky: it is an old record, and in those times Orcs used the human alphabet - before they invented their own.

So you can read the bit about the Orb?

Yes I can, but desist with your nagging! Right, lad. This Orb was brought from Dead City, believe it or not. And no living human can get into Dead City!

Hah, "something" is right! The villagers call the whole area "Dead City", and I am talking about the actual town. Of course one can go to the area, but as soon as you get close to the city wall, not to mention walking through the gates, you will be gone forever! That is how it is, birdbrain!

And I know how to get there! I mean I do not actually know, but I could easily find out...

Oh, am I? I will show you what I can do! You will not see me again before I find out how to get into that city!

Airy, stop! Where are you going, you foolish girl? An unruly little devil, is she not? Just like I used to be!
