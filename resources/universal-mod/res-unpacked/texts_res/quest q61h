Stealing cage key
A woman has not enough strength to kill Kardaur. So she must steal the key, not try and take it by force. One must be very careful near the cage of prisoners: the guards there take their duties very seriously and will attack anyone who comes near, regardless of rank and position.

Find the lieutenant
Lieutenant Kardaur can usually be found in the citadel at the eastern end of the fortress. The citadel stands on the bluff bank of the river flowing at the bottom of the canyon. To get there you must open the gates.

Get the keys
A woman does not have the strength to kill Kardaur quickly and silently. Even if she tries, he will scream and the guards will come. Then there will be practically no way to escape them. A better course would be to try and steal the keys from the lieutenant, and hope that he will not notice.

Open the cage
After you have the keys go back and open the prisoner's cage. And do not forget about the vigilant guards.
