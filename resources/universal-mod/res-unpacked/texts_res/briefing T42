It is a small town really, so everyone knows by now that you are one of those who searches for the Princess. So old Sver the Trapper will tell you this, sonny: it is good business to help a damsel in distress but it is also a dangerous one. There was another one before you who asked questions too. And he disappeared without a trace.

So what happened to him? Do you know?

How would I know? He was a newcomer like you. They even say he came from the capital, a specialist who knew how to find missing people. A Snoop, in a word. So he sniffed around, looked at footprints through a round glass, made a lot of smoke with his pipe and said all sorts of clever words.

A city man but a sensible guy really, so he managed to uncover something. Last time I saw him he was so happy about something or other... but not for long, mind you - he went east of the city and that was the last we ever saw of him. I heard a rumor he was murdered...

But if you knew where he went why did you not try to find him?

I do not want to know, my dear fellow; I must think about number one, always.  Our local villain merchant Karansul lowered skin prices again. So I have to move to make ends meet!

Hmm... the Snoop obviously did not disappear by chance. Mayhap if I solve this mystery, I will get a clue which would take me to the Princess?
