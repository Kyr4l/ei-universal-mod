Hmm... Frankly, I do not know what I am supposed to say. I am Rivar. People call me Hulk. They elected me as their new Captain. And the Elder raised no objections for some reason, although he is aware I am not too enamored of fighting.

Well, if you do not know what to say let me suggest something. Why not start with "I swear I will never do the Chosen any harm, and let anyone who tries be punished severely!"

I swear I will never do the Chosen any harm, and let anyone who tries to do that be punished severely!
#DESC Eager, happy, solemn

My, sounds really nice! I could never say it so well, I am a very poor speaker.

And? You have other talents. Look at your arms! I bet you are the strongest man in the village.

Hah, I guess so... probably that is why they elected me Captain. My father was also the strongest, and my grandfather and his father before him.  We have a family secret - how to increase physical strength. A secret word - you do not say it loudly, you just whisper it to yourself. Want me to show you? Want me to whisper it to you now?
#DESC Pretends to be modest but clearly with pride

All right, why not? Mayhap it will work!

#phrase Hero  8
Well? Do not tarry, whisper it, Hulk!

It is done! Just try, you will see the difference! But do not thank me, or it will work no more.
