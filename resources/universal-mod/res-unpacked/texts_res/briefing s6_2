Oh Chosen! I put together all the rumors, legends and lore of our village elders and came to an amazing conclusion - our island is not so isolated as it seems. We must find out if this is indeed true, and if you could find a way to communicate with other lands - with my humble assistance, of course - our village would be tremendously happy...

Oh!... Well, I am sure that in other lands I could find really powerful Magicians who would restore my memory! It would be much easier just to go through a Portal over there than to run all over this devastated land of Gipath!

There is a Chief of a small Goblin tribe named GoGo. He has a blue stone where one of his eyes should be. I heard that in ancient times that they used to make Portals out of such material, and those Portals could transport people from one place to another in a split second. If we could find out where that stone came from, then I could tell whether or not we have such a Portal in Gipath or not.

An excellent idea! But where do I find that... what's his name... GoGo?

He will come to us himself and tell us everything he knows. GoGo's tribe worships the First Goblin; they still have his skull. If we lay our hands on that sacred object, GoGo would do anything to get it back! This is what it looks like...

One would have to be a Goblin to worship such a... eh... sacred object!

But please - not a word about the Portal before we find it. No need to give the people false hopes!

As if I would repeat this to anyone! The first thing I shall do is to use that Portal myself, and that will be the last they ever see of me. Mayhap not... after all, they do seem to pin all their hopes on me... Aaaahhh!... This village existed for a hundred years without a Chosen, so they will easily survive another hundred without one!
