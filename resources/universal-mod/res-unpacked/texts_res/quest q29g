Khadaganians
The Khadaganian official promised that the unit commander would help the Chosen to leave Gipath. Even if that official did slightly exaggerate the hospitality and goodwill of his leader, you should meet him anyway. The Khadaganian expedition camp is located in the eastern part of the Remote Mountains.

Find the camp
There are two rivers in Remote Mountains: one flows out of the central part of the Big Lake from north to south; the other starts from the spring in the eastern part of the mountains and flows to the south-west. The Khadaganian camp is located a short distance to the north from the second river bank, about midstream.

To talk to the head of the unit you must first speak with one of the soldiers.
