It is unfortunate that you wish to leave us, Brother. I hoped that you would be able to take my place after I go. Think about that.

My mind is made up, Brother Khatul.

Your journey will be dangerous: the Portal is guarded as if t'were the way to a treasure house of gold, and not just to the Useless Lands. But one of our Brothers does know how to get there. Brother Faceless, I rely on you! Brother Blondie is worthy of our assistance.

Oh yes, Brother Khatul. In the northern foothills of the desert where the Portal is located there is a cave. We will meet there and I will show Brother Blondie how to obtain the key which opens the Portal and explain how to get past the patrols. I swear he will get everything he deserves!
