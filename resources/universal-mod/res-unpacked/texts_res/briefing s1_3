I am in your debt, Chosen! And I thank you on behalf of the other villagers too! Now we can take our remaining animals to pastures without fear of Goblins. And if the heavens show some mercy we can at least keep a small herd. I certainly hope so...

I do not understand, Erfar. There is no danger of Goblins now but you talk as if you were about to lose your last pig!

It is not only Goblins, but also wolves who attack our herd every night. But perhaps, Chosen,  you could deal with the wolves too?

Do you expect me to run after miserable wolves? That is a job for a shepherd dog, not for me!

These wolves are far from miserable, Chosen! The pack who steals our pigs is no ordinary pack, and its leader, the White Wolf, is more cunning than any dog... How many times has he eluded our Hunters! Only you, Chosen, could outwit that beast. Your intelligence and cunning will give the White Wolf no chance at all!

Hm... All right.  But would not that little Dragon scare the White Wolf off before time? I saw a little glittering Dragon several times here in Gipath. And every time he came just when something was about to happen!

I do not know of this dragon, Chosen. Perhaps you can see more than we mere mortals.
