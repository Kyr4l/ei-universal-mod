Spells and Skills
Experience received by any of your characters may be used to improve that character's skills or acquire new abilities. You also can give spells to characters, or store them in your inventory.  If a character's stamina or magic skills are insufficient to cast a particular spell, you will not be able to give the spell to that character.
