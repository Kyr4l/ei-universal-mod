Oh, our young hero? No luck with the search for the Princess, ehh? Or have you given up already?

You were right when you told me about the difficulties, Diera. I am completely lost though I searched all the areas around the city. But I heard that the abandoned mines is a good place to hide anyone. Do you think I should try there?

Oh come on now dear, you do not want to believe silly nonsense like that, do you? Of course you can try if you want to waste your time, but I will let you in on a secret: the road to the mines is hard and dangerous and the entrances underground collapsed a long time ago.

And you may come across cruel bandits around there. If you stick your nose in the mines, you might lose it - along with your head.

So dear boy, all that talk about the old mines is just silly nonsense, I will not waste my time with this... I have so many things to do... I hope you can take a hint?

Oh yes, of course, I beg your pardon!

Right! Why would she try so hard to convince me not to go near the mines if there was nothing hidden there!

And it was no coincidence that she suddenly had no more time to spare... Maybe she suspects that I know something already and now wants to warn her mercenaries?
