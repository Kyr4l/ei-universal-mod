I do not know anything about Joons - they lived too long ago. I always thought the stories about them were just fairy tales. I think you should look for a red-skinned young man in the Guards' dungeons - those dogs do not like people who look unusual in any way!

And if in the process you finish off one or two more guards, that would be fine by me. And if that includes Lash-Aga and Whip-Aga, t'would be even better. They are brothers, and it would have been much better if their mother had died before she met their father!

What strange names!

Not names, but the nicknames people gave them...you can guess why. I have very old scores to settle with them, very old scores indeed. If I had not come here I would have found someone willing to rend the lash and break the whip! But on the other hand, I could ask you to do it, could I not?

You could ask, but I can promise nothing!

There is no need to make promises, I have not taken promises seriously for a very long time now... so I will just tell you how you can find Lash-Aga and Whip-Aga and you decide for yourself whether you can deal with them or not.

As we speak, these two jackals torture the peons who work the plantations northeast of the city. One of the brothers supervises the central plantations, the other the southern ones. You will find it easily - there is a network of canals.

Find and kill them! No one will miss them and I would be eternally grateful.
