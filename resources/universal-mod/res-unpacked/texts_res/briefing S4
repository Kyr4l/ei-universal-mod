Chosen! Let me give you some good advice. I mean about Babur and your talks with him. Please keep in mind that he has committed many offenses!

What, I? I would never presume! No, Chosen. But I would ask you to dwell upon this. Every time you talk with Babur you risk your reputation. And as to doing what he asks of you - I  humbly advise you not to. Believe me, Chosen, this would benefit you and everyone else!
