Look - could I offer this to the Witch?

Yes, that is a Magic Bit all right, and you can ask a fair price for it too. But personally, I would never go there! The road to the cave where Estera lives is closed by magic traps.

And is there no way to bypass them?

I never tried to do that - I am no fool to risk certain death! But I do know a way, though t'will not be easy. You see, these traps are controlled by magic obelisks. And you need a special key for them.

How do you know about that?

Well, who else but me would have made a spare key for the Witch? And this is what it looks like...

Old Estera keeps it somewhere at the end of the western ravine. There are traps there too, but the lightning strikes hit only certain points. So you could try and bypass them and then switch off the obelisk which controls the traps. It is not far from there, at the end of the ravine...

But there is another problem: a Troll is always near that key. He never bothers the Witch, but if someone tries to get to the key and the Troll sees him... I mean, that big beastie would have a nice breakfast then, would he not? Or supper - depends on the time of day, really.

Well, thanks a lot. Is that all you can tell me? Any tips or hints, mayhap?

But of course! Here is my advice: when you show Estera the Magic Bit, wait until she names her price. When she does, wait a wee bit more, then ask for three times as much. She will pay, never fear! But remember, my cut is the half.

Does he really think I shall haggle with the Witch about the price? What I need from her is help, not coins. I have done the villagers quite a few favors, now it is time to think about myself!
