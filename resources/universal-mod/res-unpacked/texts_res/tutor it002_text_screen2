     The different Game zone screens show what quests you need to complete in each zone, and the approximate location of the quest. The quests themselves are displayed with special symbols.

     If you place your cursor on a zone, its name will appear in the upper-right corner of the screen, followed by a list of all quests which are still active in that zone. 

     To get more detailed information on the quests you need to complete in a given zone  just click on the zone itself. A "Quests Screen" for the zone will appear.

     Note: an island's map shows only surface areas. The subterranean Game zones are marked either as separate areas or with dotted lines on the ground.
