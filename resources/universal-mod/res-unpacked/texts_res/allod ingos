Ingos
Ingos is part of the Canian Empire. Its territory, however, is quite large and thinly populated, so tribes of other races still inhabit this land. Ingos is divided into several provinces, each of which is ruled by a governor, who, in turn, is supported by guards assigned from the capital city. Ingos' residents still enjoy considerable freedom, though. They are very independent and not at all famous for their willingness to comply with authorities.
