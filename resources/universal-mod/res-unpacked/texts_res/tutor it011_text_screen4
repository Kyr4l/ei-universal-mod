     If you want to deconstruct a spell, click on it and it will appear in a constructor's slot. In the lower-left corner of the screen you'll see the total cost of deconstructing the spell.
     If you remove the keystone from its slot in the constructor after you've deconstructed the spell, the runes contained in it will also be removed.
     When you deconstruct a spell from the shop, we assume you have purchased it (sorry, shoplifting is another chapter), so the runes from the spell will go into your inventory.

     To deconstruct a spell click on the "V" button
     To cancel click the "X" button

     Note: if you deconstruct a spell and then construct it immediately afterwards you'll still be charged for constructing and deconstructing.
