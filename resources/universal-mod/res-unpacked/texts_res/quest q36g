Opening passage to valley
You know that there is a tunnel leading to the valley. You can open it by using the lever in the mountain passage to the east of the river. Remember, the Khadaganian camp is located in this area, and nothing good will come of it should you fall foul of them!

Switch on the lever
You should switch the lever on and then return to the tunnel entrance. The people who built the system probably provided some means to get to the opening gates quickly - mayhap that mysterious set nearby?
