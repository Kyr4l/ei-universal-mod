Right, now give me the Orb... Easy, easy, you almost dropped it! It is a valuable and fragile thing and you are so clumsy!

All right, all right, here is the Orb, all in one piece. So what do we do with it now?

You do not do anything. Just watch and remember what you see. And now I will try to make it show us images from your past.

The time for silence is no more,
Now, oh shining glass,
Show us what we do not know,
And take us to the past!

What was that? What happened to the Orb? Who was that man, why did I see him? Tell me!

Come, come, no need to get so excited... I do not really know what it was all about. I could only guess. That old man in the Orb was not you, lad, do not worry about that. I would say he was the Master of the Orb, and may some Goblin have me for dinner if he is not a greater Magician than me! If anyone can help you, it is he. Try to find him.

So I will have to find out where the Orcs got the Orb. But how?

Well, I hear that every Orc tribe has a Seer who keeps their records. If you can get the records of the Orcs who had the Orb, then maybe I could figure out where it came from. Probably that chronicler lives where there are more Orc than in any other area - and in the river delta that can only be the central island. That is where you must go!
