They are real, my wee tools! Chosen, now you may order whatever you want from me! Err, well, I do not make spells for magic stuff, you have to talk to the Witch about that. But for regular work I would even give you a discount...

I mean, a small discount, of course...

I mean, if you really ask me to...

Oh relax, I do not want any discounts from you.  But tell me:  how come Free Hunters live so close to the Goblins but they have not beat each other to a pulp yet?

Free Hunters... In my book Brigands they were and Brigands they will stay. And never mind what the Elder says! That was not the first time that they robbed me...

Look, could we talk about your grudges later? I asked you about the Goblins!

And what do you think I just told you? Listen! There is a rumor that Brigands have dealings not only with Goblins but even with Orcs. Some of the villagers swear they saw a Brigand - Redhead his nickname is - talking with an Orc a couple of times on the road to the Troll cave.

Well, that is quite clear. The forest men lead the Elder a merry dance and at the same time pretend to be the village saviors!

Leading Erfar a merry dance? I wonder...

I am sure I am right! We just have to find that Redhead, then we will get to the bottom of it.
