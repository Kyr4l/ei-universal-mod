No dragons! But the treasure is still there...

I have been to that mountain and never saw any dragons there - young or old. So t'is all but fairy tales. The Chosen surely just made it up to appear a hero.

And the treasure - was that a tale as well?
#phrase Hero  3
No, that was actually true, though the treasure turned out to be rather modest - only a rusty iron sword... The old dragon gave one to the Chosen also, but that one had a spell in it, while mine is but a rusty piece of iron... And nothing much can be done about it, because Babur does not know how to work with metals.

So you took risks for nothing?
#phrase Hero  5
Oh no! I gained experience, and as they say, you cannot drink that away, can you?
