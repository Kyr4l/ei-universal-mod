Our village is short of valuables due to the ongoing war with the orcs in the Sands. I heard that there are harpies in the remote mountains who have great treasure.

Hmmm... To be honest, I'm expecting a lot of trouble! Harpies are serious opponents and they are unlikely to part with their treasure voluntarily.

There will be no difficulties! I just want you to take the harpies treasure. You don't even have to fight them... in theory.

Of course, this is still a dangerous undertaking. Fine i'll do it! But I want part of the treasure as a reward!
