There is a rule in the brotherhood of the Last Shelter: if a good man is in trouble and we can help, then we will. Now an antiques collector named Baluddin is in trouble, and I would like to help him.

Hmmm... Is he really a good man?

Do you doubt my word? There is nothing wrong with that: only doubts can lead you to the truth. I will tell you about Baluddin!

Brother Blondie told me that Baluddin gave shelter to an unknown man of very strange appearance, and he was very upset when that man was captured by the guards.

I concluded that Baluddin was a noble man albeit in tight circumstances, so I sent him a message. Now Baluddin reports to us about the latest developments in the city, and we occasionally help him to extend his collection.

The commander of one of the guards' units found out about it and arrested Baluddin; he also set up an ambush near his home.

We must kill the guards who know why the collector has been arrested and get him home; that way no one will know what actually happened!
