I must have agreed to become the elder of our village on a bad day! For we have had no peace since then: Goblins, Orcs, Lizards and now those undeads near Dead City!

So what? Of course skeletons are not much fun, but they have been keeping themselves close to the ruins, have they not?
#phrase Nsheriff  3
That is true, skeletons do not venture far away from their graves. But I am not talking about them: if there is no grave, the undeads can go anywhere! For example, right here into the village, know what I mean?

Hmm... And where did that wonder of the world come from?
#phrase Nsheriff  5
From the same old place - it is all because of the Chosen's adventures! He told that in the Dead City land, north-west of the city, the skeletons attacked the Khadaganian expedition camp. And of course nobody bothered to bury the dead.

And it seems one of the dead was a Necromancer, so his magic still works even though he is gone! In a word, undeads are now wandering all around the camp, and they can come here any time.

So we must destroy them, and the sooner the better! I think I could deal with that.
