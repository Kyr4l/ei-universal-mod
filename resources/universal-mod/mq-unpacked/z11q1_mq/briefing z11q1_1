The Duke has ordered me to take care of a problem. Poachers hunting on the Duke's hunting grounds...this must stop!

The city guards report that they discovered deer killed in the hunting area outside the city. It's best to look there first to find these poachers.

You must understand that the Duke's concerns are also mine, as the hunting grounds around the city also support us. We can't afford to share these grounds with any outsiders.

All right, I'll go and drive these poachers away. But there has to be something for me in it other than a warm soup once I return!

Of course my friend, the Duke is kind and generous to his allies! As long as they serve him faithfully.
