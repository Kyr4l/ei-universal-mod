Our ally the Shei-Var Clan of orcs, has asked us for help. They report that the three ogres living in the Sands have joined forces with their enemies!

Let me guess... You're probably going to ask me to take care of it?

Correct! We must stand by our allies. They keep the Sands under control for us.

Be careful, these ogres are serious opponents! They are really tough and very strong. And while you're there you can also plunder the ogres' treasures!
