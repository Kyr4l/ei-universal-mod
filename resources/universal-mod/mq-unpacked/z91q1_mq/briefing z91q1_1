The old witch reported that the path to the Great Mage was blocked. Now we have to take a dangerous path through the lava caves. Can you make the path safer for us?

As long as there is a reward for it... and a good one! It sounds pretty dangerous!
#phrase Sheriff  3
Of course, whatever we can muster shall be yours. I'm sure you're up to it.

Now go and clear the corridors of all the lava elementals. However, beware of the golems!
