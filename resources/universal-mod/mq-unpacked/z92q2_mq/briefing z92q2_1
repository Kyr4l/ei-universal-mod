The lizards that live in the remote mountains originally come from a distant land. It is said that it was once an idyllic land, but today it is withered and desolate. Recently young dragons have been spotted. The lizards must have brought these from their homeland, because dragons have been extinct in Gipath for a very long time.

Dragons?!... You mean those big, flying lizards that kill and eat everyone that crosses their path?!
#phrase sheriff  3
Yes, that is correct. But do not worry, they are young ones and not yet reached their full potential.

But once fully grown, no one can stand against them anymore! You have to kill them all, because the lizards in the remote mountains are allies with them, they are unfortunately not as friendly to us.
