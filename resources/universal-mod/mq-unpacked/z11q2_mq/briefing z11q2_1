My good friend, the city is short of money and if we don't get more gold we won't be able to pay people like you anymore.

I heard there's a treasure far to the south. However, I don't believe in fairy tales and so far there has been no reason to risk the lives of my people.

You look adventurous to me. Maybe you would like to see if there is any truth to the stories? As a reward, I promise you a good share of the treasure if it really exists.

Well, that's a great... I'm going to walk around the area on a chance basis to find a fairytale treasure and then perhaps be rewarded?

I'm sorry my friend, I can't offer you another assignment at the moment! Now go, I have an important meeting with the city guards soon.
