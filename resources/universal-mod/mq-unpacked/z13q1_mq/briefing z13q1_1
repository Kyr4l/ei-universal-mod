My good friend merchant Karansul asked me for a... well... a favour of sorts. He's worried that his factories on the eastern lake shore stopped working.

There had been no deliveries and no news at all from them for a long time now, so no one knows what is happening. Karansul asked me to help with that problem, so I in turn ask you to see to it.

You understand that my friend's troubles make me rather upset, and an upset governor can make life miserable for everyone under his command!

So it would be in your own interest to go into Karansul's domain, find out the reason of this and then eliminate it!
