I am very worried about captain Tilvar! There was no news at all from him since I sent him with a party to kill all those wormheads near the mines!
#phrase Huber  2
I need a man who is prepared to go north across the lake and find out what happened to him. And I believe you may well be that man!
#phrase Hero  3
I would be honored, Your Excellency! But I would like to understand one thing: I thought Wormheads were subterranean creatures? Do you expect me to go underground and fight them down there?
#phrase Huber  4
Oh no, let those nightmarish creatures live in their catacombs for as long as they might care! I only told Tilvar to kill the ones who dared to venture outside!

And you might also take part in this enterprise - and if my worst fears are realized, you will have to do the job alone. I cannot promise you a reward, but the experience you gain will be priceless!
