Listen, since you removed the Big Shell from the Remote Mountains,  I can no longer go to the quarry. I am helpless!

Oh dear, is that not awful! Do not try to be clever, you are like an open book for me.
#DESC Lightly, a bit mockingly

I am not clever or anything else! But if that road to the quarry were to be opened again, I would pay you well. Exceedingly well!
#DESC Abruptly changes to businesslike

Hmm, sounds good... but I am not going to take that Shell back, the damn thing is too heavy!

Hah, and what if I told you that you do not need to lift the Shell! There is another road to my quarry, a long one, 'tis true, but I cannot use it because of a Cyclops.

A Cyclops? What kind of beast is that?

No beast, Chosen. Cyclops look like Ogres but they are much, much cleverer.  At least the one I mean is definitely no fool: he stole a whole herd of pigs from our shepherds, and now he tends to them himself. When he spots anyone, he throws large stones at them. Sort of keeps them at a distance, so to speak.

Please understand, I care not a whit for Cyclops or pigs, but that herd grazes right next to my quarry.

So I think that if you could exterminate those wee pigs, the Cyclops would simply go away. Then I would indeed show my gratitude!

And another thing: remember to watch the sky when you go to the Remote Mountains, I have seen Dragons flying there!
