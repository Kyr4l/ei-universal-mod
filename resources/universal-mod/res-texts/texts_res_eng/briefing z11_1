The villagers say that Dead City was built by ghouls - but these are just fairy tales. I would even say, old women's tales if I were not one myself, he-he! Actually the city was built by people, but a long, long time ago. I will tell you about it...

Oh I see, so that is who left all those ruins, bridges and statues behind...

Do you want to tell the story? Listen and do not interrupt me! The ruins one can see all over Gipath are the legacy of another, very ancient people, and no one knows anything about them. That is not who I mean at all!

Yes, so after these ancient people disappeared, Gipath was a remote and desolate land for a long time. But then people came here again. The world was united then, and one could get anywhere easily, without any problems. In a word, a certain king decided he liked the look of Gipath, so he sent his soldiers and builders here.

Very soon the fortress appeared in the mountains, and everything seemed to be just fine, but then the Night of Troubles came, when the world split into separate lands. And not only the fortress was cut off from the kingdom - very bad business went on there.

Skeletons were coming out of their graves at night to attack live people, and those attacked turned into skeletons right in front of the others! So the clever ones ran as far away as they could, while the others simply disappeared. The people who live in the village today are the descendants of those fugitives, and the fortress is now called Dead City.
