Subterranean creatures
The Old Dragon respects old traditions, so he will promise to tell you something of interest but in return will ask that you exterminate the armadillos who constantly annoy him. To make your task easier, the dragon will give you poison to use on one of the three underground rivers.

Kill the Armadillo Mother
If you let the large female armadillo live, she will give birth to many more baby armadillos and the Old Dragon will never have peace and quiet. Better attack her after one of the springs is poisoned - she will not die of the poisoned water but she will be much weakened.

Exterminating small Armadillos
They are the ones who irritate the Old Dragon with their fussing and messing around.
