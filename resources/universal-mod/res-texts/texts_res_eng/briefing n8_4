Ho Sandwoman, you say village people cowards-cowards, and no one come here. And this one did come! Wants talk-talk with you.

Hm, so you are the Chosen then? The Orcs told me about you but I thought you were different.

My name's is Eila, I escaped from the village a long time ago to become the Witch's apprentice. But that braggardly woman decided I was no good! So I went to the Brigands but it was the same story again with that spiteful cat the Chieftess. It was a good thing that Redhead mentioned Chief Shei-Var to me: he is an Orc, true, but one can come to terms with him.

So you came to terms with him?

As you can see. The Orcs call me Sandwoman, but I do not take any other nonsense from them. The Seer teaches me magic, and in exchange I fight for him. The Shei-Var tribe have many enemies! So Redhead gave me good advice indeed. If you see him, say hello from me!

Oh people, come, talk-talk later. And now I want a word-word with you, Sandwoman. Chosen wants do business-business for me. If he need, you help-help him, I give you permission, allow-allow!
