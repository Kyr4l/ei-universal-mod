I have had a look at your finds... you really did get lucky, you know! It makes one wonder if you are indeed an ordinary man, or mayhap there is a bit of a Chosen in you?

Right, now listen, sweetheart. There is a secret passage to the city, like a narrow corridor in the mountain. It starts south of the gate. To enter, you must say, "Valir and Cania!"

No idea what it means, but it sounds impressive. Next thing: if I were master of the Dead City, I would settle down on the top of Lone Mountain. You can see it from afar, no way to miss it. That is where you must go.

Well, good luck! And when you meet that old man, be polite! You can be insolent to old useless toads like myself, but you must treat serious Magicians respectfully!
