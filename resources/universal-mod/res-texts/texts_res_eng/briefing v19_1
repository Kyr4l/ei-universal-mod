Gort! I was told this note was written by you, it is your handwriting. And that means you are the traitor!

Whaaat? That wart put the blame on me?! All right then! You want a traitor? I'll give you a traitor! Ha, it is probably for the best... I am sick of people telling me what to do. I shall be the new boss in this village!

Yes, he is indeed a lowly man, a scoundrel! But do not err - he is still dangerous, he and his people! Oh dear, I trusted him so much... there can be no excuse for someone so naive!

We must catch Gort and kill him before he gathers all the remaining Brigands and returns with them. He cannot have gone too far, so if you make haste, you will catch him in the Foothills!
