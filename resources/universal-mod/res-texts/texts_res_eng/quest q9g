Bringing Orc document
The Orcs gave the Goblin chief GoGo a "hide with letters" - a record of the story of the blue stone; but when they found out about the loss of the idol they were not amused and took the record back. Now this hide is in the coffer on Bald Island (also called "Barren"). Note: You can only reach the islands by means of the drawbridge. To lower the bridge you must have the mechanism of the Island Orcs (that of the cave Orcs will be of no help to you). If you do not have it, ask the Captain about it.

Find "Bald Island"
Judging by the name, the island should be almost without vegetation. GoGo says it is located somewhere to the south-east.

Take the "Hide with letters"
The Orc records are hidden in the coffer. You must open it and take the "Hide with letters".
