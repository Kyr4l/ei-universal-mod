When I sent you to Suslanger I expected you to find friends there who would help you in your quest.

However, I absolutely did not expect you to bring anyone here to Gipath! I certainly do not blame you for that, but was it not somewhat reckless?

Mayhap it was, but I could not leave anyone there at the Portal, could I? It would have meant certain death for them!

That may be true. Still, I do not want any newcomers here in my cave!

So what do we do? Will you harm the person who helped me in the mission which you gave me?

How many times must I tell you, Zak: when you are too hasty and make presumptions, mistakes will happen! I do not intend to harm anyone. I shall simply make a reverse teleport, and everything will be normal again.

And I have learned much from your example, and will make sure that the journey from the Portal to a safe location goes unnoticed by the Khadaganian guards.
