Well done Chosen! That was clever, to expose the Elder like that! Though between you and me, if you think about it carefully, you will also come to the conclusion that Erfar is easily the most suspicious character in the village. First of all, he is a newcomer.

What you mean? Where did he come from, and why did no one tell me that?

That is the whole point! Erfar just appeared in the village as a grown man. He said he had been kidnapped by the Brigands when he was a child and that he allegedly escaped from them. And he told it so convincingly, even I myself believed him.

Then in no time at all Erfar was bosom friends with Gort and was voted assistant to the previous Elder - so it would have been somehow impolite to remember that he was an alien. And that was that. So what will you do with him now?

What will I do with him? The same thing he was going to do to me! Erfar will have to try really hard to make me change my mind!
