     Once you've chosen a Game zone in the Global Map, you'll see a Quest screen. The upper-right area shows a simplified map of the zone. You should see at least one triangle here, and possibly more.
     The green triangles indicate Transfer areas. Your character can enter the Game zone through these. Select the one you want to use to enter the Game zone by clicking on it. Notice that it gets bigger. This means it is "selected" and you can enter now.
     The red triangles mark Transfer areas that are unavailable to your character. 

     If you see no green triangles on the zone map it means there is another "unexplored" game zone lying somewhere between your character's current position and the present Game zone you're trying to enter. You'll need to find it and get your character through it in order to continue.

     To enter a Game zone press the "V" button at the bottom of the screen.
     To return to the Global Map press the "X" button at the top of the screen.
