Hah! You do not have any use for it, do you? And I need it for my prestige and authority. That is the custom, you see?

I like that! When someone has to run around and catch wolves, you go moaning "Oh dear Chosen, will you please help us?" And when it is done, you take all the credit.

And you begrudge it, do you not? What is it, caught the meanness bug from Babur the Tightfist? And I hoped we would be friends. And the Elder already told everyone you would help me with my plan...

We will see how it goes. As to the Elder and the plan - tell me about it later.
