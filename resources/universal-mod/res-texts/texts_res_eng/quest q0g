Reaching people
You cannot survive in a strange and dangerous world alone. You must find a human settlement.

Leave the ruins
If the ruins are anything to go by, there should be people living here - or at least they used to. To find them, first of all leave the ruins and explore the surrounding area thoroughly.

Go after the people who flee
Yes, people do live here! Although they run away as soon as they see a stranger come out of the ruins... You could not catch them, but at least now you can guess where a human settlement may be. But do not rely on a good road in this wilderness: mayhap you must go alongside the river or even ford it.

Go to the village
The village is located east of the ford, but use caution: mayhap there are dangerous creatures in the vicinity of the human settlement.
