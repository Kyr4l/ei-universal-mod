Slavedriver's hiding place
There's a rumour that plantation slavedrivers accepted bribes to send peons to work in the gardens of rich people. T'would be rather nice to find the hiding place of one of those slavedrivers, just to inspect it, of course!

Plantation
This plantation looks worse than any of those nearby. Probably the peons spent more time in the city houses than they did at work here.....

Find the hiding place
The local slave driver would hardly risk taking his bribe money home. It is probably hidden somewhere around here.

It is indeed interesting to see just how much a modest whip and lash worker can save for a rainy day, and all from his meager wages!
