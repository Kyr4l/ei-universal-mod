And what about those Brigands, eh? If they steal from me, they would steal from the Elder - it is all the same to them! And I am sure they kidnapped my apprentice too! And if the Elder wants to put the blame on me again, let him either prove it or take those words back.

Did the Captain and the Elder help me when my coffers were turned inside out? Aha, now I shall pay them back in kind!
