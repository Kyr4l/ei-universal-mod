     When you order your character to attack an enemy you can specify what body part he should aim at. Use the following keypad keys for precise blows:

     <4>: aim at left hand (left fore leg)
     <6>: aim at right hand (right fore leg)
     <1>: aim at left leg
     <3>: aim at right leg
     <5>: aim at body
     <8>: aim at head

     To land a precise blow, hold the appropriate key down, and place the cursor over the enemy. Your character will aim right at the specified body part until you issue a different command or until the health of this body part reaches 0. If the enemy is still alive, additional blows will not be precise ones.

    Some of the beings in the game have no arms or legs. If you issue a command to aim at a nonexistent body part your character will just ignore it.

    All characters' body parts can be protected by armor which has specific "armor" properties - so the damage inflicted on such protected body parts reduced.
