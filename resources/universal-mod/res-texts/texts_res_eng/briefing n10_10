Hey lad, I always said you were special! You talk to Great Magicians on an equal footing, and your girl is really the cat's whiskers!

If only she were mine...

Well, she will be, never fear! Believe you me, I can see such things... but do not ask me for advice: you must work everything out for yourself. And now I must leave you: let the Great Magician send me back to Suslanger! I do not want to stay here: I would feel bad if I stole from friends, and I was born into thievery!

Not goodbye. Farewell!
