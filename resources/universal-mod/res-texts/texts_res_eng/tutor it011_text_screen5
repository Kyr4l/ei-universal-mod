     A composite spell is one made up of a keystone and more than one additional rune. This type of spell cannot require less energy than a similar spell which contains only the keystone. Thus, the rune "Extra Energy" can never be used alone. It's only useful for composite spells as it compensates for the increased energy needed by the additional runes.
