I understand that you are the Elder of this village?

#phrase Elder  2
Yes. I am Elder Erfar. The people of this village entrusted me to govern them. Sometimes they call me Silvertongue, but I do not mind. I take this as a sign of respect.

Is that so? The master of this land allows people to choose who should rule them? I wonder how your king feels about that...

Alas, Chosen, we have no master and no king. No one has use for such a desolate land as Gipath. The village exists alone, and we know not how to reach other lands.

So one could say I am indeed the leader here and must make all decisions. It is a task both difficult and demanding, but I bear my cross for the sake of my people! The good Captain here is always here to aid me. And I can proudly say that we have good order here, no worse than any king could establish.

But what about the other villages - do they manage on their own too?

There are no other villages. Ours is the only one in Gipath. A very long time ago a forgotten people lived here, but now only ruins and abandoned roads are left, with Goblins and Orcs all around us.

I see... Well, that is quite a surprise. I must think about it.

Merciful Heavens! What is this place, what has happened to me?! I know I was not born here - but where, then? I feel I was supposed to do something, but what? I must find out, but who could help me?!!
