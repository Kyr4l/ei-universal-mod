Erfar! I would like to hear your story about the Magic Orb! You cannot have forgotten it... I was told that you are the man who most definitely knows all the answers.

Of course I remember about the Orb. But it was a very long time ago, really, and it's a long, long story...

That is all right, I am in no hurry. Just tell me, do not beat about the bush.

Well, we caught a Goblin once and it turned out he was the Orc Seer's servant. Goblins are stupid creatures, so it was a difficult task to get any sense out of him.

I could only understand that the Magic Orb lies on the altar somewhere on the southernmost island. And apparently the Orcs value it very highly, so they keep the island under a strong guard. I am so sorry, Chosen, but if you thought you could lay your hands on the Orb, you will have to forget it: the road to the Remote Island is so dangerous, even you should not risk it!

The main thing is to have a mechanism for the drawbridge to the islands; and to reach the altar will be my problem!
