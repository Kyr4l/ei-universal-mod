Welcome to Evil Islands!

This is the tutorial system.  It will appear on the screen from time to time during the 'introductory' quest. 

Some of the longer tutorials will include several screens. To move from screen to screen, use the buttons at the bottom. Please be sure to read the tutorials carefully. A great deal of very useful information is in the tutorials.

Keep in mind that while the tutorials are up on the screen, gameplay is "paused".

Most screen elements (such as menus, icons, etc) have pop-up tips. Placing the cursor over an element for a few seconds will cause the tip will appear.

To see the last tutorial screen again, just press the <H> key.

Note: the controls described here are default controls. If you change your default settings, some descriptions may no longer be accurate.
