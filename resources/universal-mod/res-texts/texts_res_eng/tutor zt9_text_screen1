     Depending on the situation, you can put your character in one of two modes.
     
     In Aggressive mode the character will automatically attack all enemies he sees.
     In Defensive mode the character will not attack any enemies until you issue the command to attack a particular one.

     To switch to one of these modes, use the (currently highlighted) control panel at the lower-left of the screen, or use the <A> key.

     Note: you can assign any of these modes to any individual character.
