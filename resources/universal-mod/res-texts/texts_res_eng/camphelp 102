Items constructor
You can use items from your inventory and those available in the shop to make other items (the price of the items you buy in the shop will be taken into account). You can either construct new items using the appropriate blueprints and materials or deconstruct the ones you already have. See the lower part of the left window for details about the price of constructing/deconstructing. Use the buttons near the window to confirm or cancel.
