Quarry
The road to the quarry is now dangerous. If you make it safe Craftsman Babur would make it worth your while. You can find the quarry if you go north from the four pillars with fires.

The herd of pigs grazes in the same ravine not far from the Cyclops, to the east of the quarry.

Kill all pigs
As long as the Cyclops has enough food he will go nowhere. Remember that the pigs are not fenced in, so some may stray far. Make sure that the Cyclops does not notice you! If he does, you will fail Babur's task.

Find the quarry
You can find the quarry north of the four fiery pillars. Be cautious, and do not forget to look to the sky now and again - they say there are dragons in those parts.
