Tools
Craftsman Babur cannot and will not do any work until the tools stolen by the "Free Hunters" are returned to him (he always calls them Brigands).

Find the Chieftain of the Brigands
The camp of the brigands, where the chieftain lives with his wife, is located between the two rivers. The easiest way to reach this camp is by the ford upriver; however, beware the poisonous toads which are plentiful on the river banks.

Get the chisel
The steel chisel must be taken from the Chieftain and returned to Babur. The Chieftain is not what he is without good reason: he is a very strong fighter, so mayhap 'tis wiser not to enter into open combat against him! T'would be better for you if you slipped up stealthily to him and stole the chisel from his pocket.

Get the bodkin
The steel bodkin must be taken from the Chieftess and returned to Babur. Mark my words, she may look harmless, but in fact she is very familiar with magic and may cause you undue trouble. 'Twould be best for you to steal up close to her and slip the bodkin from her pocket.
