Karansul has me by the throat with both hands. All the locals hate him. Everyone is in debt to him, he buys our trophies for a trifle then sells them for three times more. But woe betide he who tries to find another buyer! Karansul is in league with the local rough element. One wrong move and he sends his cutthroat friends to deal with you. And that, my friend, is a goodbye of a permanent nature.

Yes, I can see it is serious. But can you not think of a way to put some pressure on this vermin?

Let us make an honest agreement - you help me and I will help you. And if you do something for me, I will tell you all I know about the merchant. All right?

What do you want me to do?

Quite simple... soon a fur buyer from the capital will come to this area. He offers good prices for skins, nothing like our mean pirate here. But I cannot get to the meeting place where he collects the skins, because Karansul's... ruffians will have their eyes on me.

But if you could take my skins there... then we could have a nice chat about the merchant! The road to the meeting place is not difficult, but the problem is, it is located in Karansul's domain. So you can understand my wariness.

All right, agreed. I will get your skins there, but first of all, tell me how I find the place...

That is easy... when you reach Karansul's domain, go to the first valley to the south. There is an old tent there with a fire burning. Near that fire are a number of forks. Hang the skins on those forks and you are done!

Just do not go wandering around there: there is a Guard unit in that area. Times are troubled, so the Guards will be inclined to shoot first and ask questions later.
