City environs
There is only one city in this province of Ingos; it is the seat of the government. The people in the surrounding villages are hostile to the citizens because of the ruinous decrees of the governor. The woods around are populated by creatures called "Woodsfolk". Their interests rarely coincide with these of humans.
