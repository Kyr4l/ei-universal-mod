Now, now, listen, an ABC Book is a totally different matter. Right... right... well, congratulations, Chosen, a wolf hunt is under way, and you are the wolf! A detailed description of you has been left in a secret place for the Orcs to find  - where you go, the company you keep, what weapons you use, all that. And so much gold is on offer, that maybe only Babur would have anything like that amount. About as much as has been stolen from the Elder! Apparently you are highly valued!

But who could be so interested in me?

How should do I know? They do not usually put their names on letters, do they? What do you think?

It must be either Babur or Erfar. They both need me, but on the other hand, they both find me kind of irritating... I must get that paper and have a good look at it; this situation cannot continue... so where is that place?

You know the way to the river, do you not? Remember it starts in a small valley?

Yes, of course! The road goes between two hills to the south.

And that secret place is on the other side of the hill, to the east. But remember, when the Orcs get that paper with your description on it, they will not tarry in wait for you. If you are late, you will have to go to the Council Mountain. Orcs usually discuss their most important business on its summit, and they would certainly consider teaching the Chosen a lesson just for the fun of it!
