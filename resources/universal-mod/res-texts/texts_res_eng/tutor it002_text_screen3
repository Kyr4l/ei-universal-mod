     The Global map shows only the zones currently available to your character, and differentiated by colors. 

     Zones in which you have completed a key quest ("explored" zones) are marked with a darker color. Your characters can bypass skip through these "explored" zones by simply clicking on the destination zone. If several such "explored" zones are adjacent and have connecting Transfer areas, you can bypass them all.

     Note: you are not required to complete all available quests within a zone or kill all enemies there in order to make it an "explored" zone.

     Zones which are available but not yet "explored" are marked with a lighter color. If you must pass through such a zone in order to complete your current quest, your characters will actually have to enter it and walk all the way through to their destination. You cannot bypass "unexplored" zones.
