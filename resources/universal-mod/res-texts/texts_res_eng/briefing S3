I knew the Chosen could not fail! This is a great day for our village! The White Wolf is dead! Long live the Chosen!

All right, all right, calm down. So I killed a cub and had some fun too... there is nothing extraordinary in that.

Your modesty becomes you, Chosen... But if this indeed is so unimportant to you, then perhaps you could give the head of the wolf to Captain Gort. This would increase his prestige in the village.

What insolence, and what a cunning old fox! Now I will have to give the wolf's head away, or they will say I do not keep my word.

What a generous man you are! The most difficult task is nothing but fun to you! But perhaps you would like to have some more fun? The Captain has a plan and I would appreciate it if you would join him in this. And I shall tell the villagers the good news that the Chosen has yet again agreed to help us!
