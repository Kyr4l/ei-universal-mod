Brother Khatul! I found this blond man deep in the Black Cave. He says he managed to escape from the Canyon of Death, beaten up but not broken. He is worthy enough to become one of us!

Are you not too trusting, Brother Blacksmith? Do you know how much gold has been promised to anyone who tells the Guards the secret of our subterranean shelter?

Our guest does not look like an Aiset-Bek spy, but a snake is a snake whatever pattern is on its skin!

The only thing I want from Aiset-Bek is to meet him armed, face-to-face.

You can change your clothes, you can fake the scars from lashes... but you cannot fake the hate which burns in the eyes of this one. I cannot believe he lies, so I ask you to test him.

All right. So, Blondie, we will accept you as an equal... if you bring me the Emperor's Signet Ring. The messenger who had it was on the way to the Emperor's vizier in Suslanger... met a Cyclops, poor devil. We know that the Cyclops has the Ring among his treasures. Bring it here!

And what will that prove? Mayhap I harm myself in your eyes when I say this...but anyone could do that, and with very different reasons too...

Brother Khatul, the trials in Death Canyon have clouded this man's mind! He even forgot what sort of punishment would face anyone who dared to touch the Emperor's Signet Ring, let alone steal it!

Brother Blacksmith, let this man decide for himself what he should do about the Ring. I will only tell him where he can find the Cyclops. So, Blondie, you will have to make your way to the Necromancers' desert and find a mountain ravine to the northwest.

The Cyclops lives there, and he is not alone: Evileyes are all around his den. You can kill or cheat Evileyes, but I would not advise you to try killing the Cyclops. And that is all I have to tell you!
