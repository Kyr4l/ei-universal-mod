Buying items 
When you are choosing items to buy in the shop, they will be put on the counter. The two top shelves of the counter hold the items you are buying, while the two bottom shelves hold the items you are selling. At the bottom left corner of the counter there are buttons with which you can confirm or cancel the transaction (buying or selling).
