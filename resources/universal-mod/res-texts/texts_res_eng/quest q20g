Dead City master
Someone controls the Dead City. Mayhap it is the powerful Magician whom you should try to meet, or perhaps you should at least ascertain where he lives? Remember, it is practically impossible to enter the Dead City through the big gates: ghouls guard them just as closely as city guards did in better times. You can enter the city through a secret passage, but to open that up, you must have the password.

Find a way into the Dead City
There is a secret passage cut through the mountains; the entrance is to the south of the large gates. The start of the secret passage is marked by two towers, but to pass between them you must know the password written in the book from the observatory.

Pass through the opened passage
The opened passage leads exactly where you must go: to the Dead City.

Find the Lone Mountain
According to incomplete information received, the master of the City lives on the top of the Lone Mountain located deep in the valley. Be very careful while you look for it: the Dead City ghouls do not only live near the large gates!

Climb Lone Mountain
The top of Lone Mountains seems to be a suitable place for the Dead City Master to live. To get there you must walk up the spiral path to the very top of the mountain.
