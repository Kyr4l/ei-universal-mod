Getting Sacred Flower
Each clan of Woodsfolk has its own sacred plant which blossoms winter and summer. The keeper of the Green Clan has been captured by the hostile White clan. You must free him, upon which he will give you the Sacred Flower. If the Keeper dies, you can take the flower from his corpse.

Cross the lake
To enter the domain of the White Clan you must go to the western shore of the upper lake, then a little further into the woods. Beware of the locals, they will attack anyone from the city.

Find the prison
The White Clan threw the Keeper into a primitive prison built of dead trees. The gates are closed, but you can open them with your bare hands. But that will not suffice....there is also a magic trap guarding the prison gates. To switch it off you will need a green leaf which the White Clan Seer carries with him.

Switch off the trap
The altar which controls the trap looks like an old stump covered with mushrooms. Well disguised indeed!

Get close to the Keeper
The Keeper is unsure whether he can bring the Sacred Flower to his Clan or not. If you open the cage gate, he will give the Flower to his rescuer. Then he will try to escape.
