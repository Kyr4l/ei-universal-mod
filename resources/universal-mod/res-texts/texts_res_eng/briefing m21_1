They say the Orc Seer has cast an illness on the village. The Elder is very scared. He begged me to bring a White Flower to him to heal the people.

Hmmm... Listen, why do you not give the Plant to me? T'will be good for business. Look, the whole village would have to come to me. I will make an excellent profit and share it with you. And we will get rid of Erfar in the bargain - I will charge him so much, that he will find it cheaper to die!

Are you mad?! Your greed has addled your brains! People could die and all you can think about is money!

Oh all right, go and listen to the others, with your "Oh, I am soooo honest!" speech. Just make sure that flower does not turn out to be the last thing you ever see!
