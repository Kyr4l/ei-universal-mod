     A "base" (whether it be a village or a city) is displayed on the Island Map with a special symbol (either with gates or a building). You have at least one "base" available on every island. If the zone containing a "base" is "explored", you can enter the base directly from the Global Map. Otherwise your character will have to walk to the base.

     Note: when you leave a base you always go right to the Global Map.
