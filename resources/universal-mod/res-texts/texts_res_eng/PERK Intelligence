Intelligence
Intelligence determines the amount of experience your character can gain. The higher this value, the more experience is gained. Also, Intelligence affects the amount of Stamina used while casting spells (the higher the Intelligence, the less Stamina is spent). Intelligence also affects the "Knowledge of Magic" parameter.
