     In the upper-right area of the screen there's a simplified map of your current Game zone. The map shows the Transfer areas, the approximate location of your quest, the area terrain and some of the local landmarks. Important points are marked as follows:

* Triangles: these are Transfer areas - the green ones are available for use, the red ones are unavailable.
* Large red cross: here's where you'll need to get to in order to complete the selected quests (shown in the left window).
* Keys: these show the locations of the keys or quest items you need to accumulate in your quest.
* Solid and dotted lines: these are roads and footpaths.
* Broad and narrow strips across water: these indicate bridges and fords.
* Skull and crossbones: these show the locations of magic traps (red indicates a fire trap, green an acid trap and blue a lightning trap).

     The map may also show other symbols for particular quests. You may, for example, see pictures of animals or monsters, coffers, sacks etc). Remember, maps provide lots of useful information, so be sure to take a good look at them before you enter the Game zone.

     At the bottom right of the screen you'll see a text window containing a description of the Game zone. This text may be short (normally), but it contains some implied hints and other tips which can be a big help to you in carrying out your quests.
