Listen, Erfar! I do not understand you: first you say that we have important business and then you forget all about it? I got that "hide with letters" GoGo told us about!

Oh Chosen! Did you really manage to get to the islands and come back alive?! That is a truly great deed! And now wait, I shall try to read what it says... by the way, did you see anything unusual on the islands? Mayhap a strange piece of rock similar in color to GoGo's eye?

Is that what the Portal is supposed to look like? No matter, because I never saw anything like that. Tell me what the hide says!

Unfortunately, nothing of value to us. Apparently I was wrong! What a disappointment...

Of course we shall continue our quest for the Portal, but now, oh Chosen, I must ask for your help in another matter. I cannot find our gold - all the money our poor people paid as taxes! And Babur's apprentice disappeared from the village that same night. Apparently the Craftsman weaves his intrigues yet again - he wants to be the master of the whole village!

So what can I do? Rush after the thief?

I am afraid even you will not find him. However, there is another way around the problem. There is a place in Gipath where a very rich caravan met with death a long time ago, during a time when another race inhabited these lands. People in the village know about it, but only I know exactly where that gold can be found.

I never revealed that secret to anyone, lest that lowly Babur grab it all. The way there is a bit dangerous but to you it would be just a walk.

The place is called Golden Valley, in that part of Gipath which borders the Dead City. To the northwest is a river loop; the valley lies on the eastern bank, about the middle of the river. If you could bring us the contents of at least one coffer, the village would be saved! But I beg of you, do not tell this secret to anyone.
