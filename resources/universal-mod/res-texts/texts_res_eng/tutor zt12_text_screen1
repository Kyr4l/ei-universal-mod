     The Information window (currently highlighted) gives you details about the game characters. If you want details on any character, just place the cursor over him/her. The Information window defaults to giving details on your own character (a.k.a. "the Hero").
     The Information window has several modes. See the next screen for more on each one.

     Note: To open/close the Information window use the (currently highlighted) triangle button at the upper-left.
