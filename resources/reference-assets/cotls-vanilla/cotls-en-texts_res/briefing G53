Ah, young man, why are you in such a hurry? What is the reason for all this haste?

The mine!

What mine? What does it mean, "the mine"? And where is "Hello", where are your manners?

Your Excellency, I apologise for my haste but I have very serious reasons to speak with you. I decided it was time for me to see sense. To start business. Mining business.

Well, your Excellency, I noticed you love beauty and I am sure I can find a lot of wonderful things in the old abandoned mines...

Hmm... Well, those are indeed serious reasons, I would even say they are critical. I see you know your manners, and you have a romantic spirit too. Indeed, what can be more romantic than a lovely, heavy golden nugget!

But to start business I will need the keys to the abandoned mines - and those keys are under your Excellency's control! I am sure I will find many other interesting things there, and the best of them may even deserve a place in your collection.

Oh, the key? Yes, I did have it somewhere... Well, if the lock is the only barrier between myself and beauty, how can I refuse you the key?
