I think you can guess that.

In a way - but it would seem that both are talking quite sensibly. And I cannot get to the bottom of it!

Oh, give me patience! You do not know anything, do you? If you cannot get to the bottom of it, make it come up to the top for you! Set up a trap!

Right... Set up a trap... Now what sort of trap could I set up... Oh yes! I will tell the folk in the village that Estera has revealed a secret to me... apparently there is another White Flower in the Middle Mountains, and I promised to get it for her.

I will tell Babur one location and the Elder another. And when I see where the ambush is, I will have found my traitor!
