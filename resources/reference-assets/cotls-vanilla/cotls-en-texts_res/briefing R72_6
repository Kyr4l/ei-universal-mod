I have a very serious question to ask you, Tka-Rik! A Khadaganian scientist managed to cheat the Joon Curse by turning me into a person who called himself Zak. Does that mean that when I return to my old self I will become a victim of the Curse yet again?

Unfortunately, that is true. Furthermore, I cannot hide you under another person's disguise again: the previous transformation spell was cast in haste and by a Magician of insufficient skill. I did not want to tell you, but you could have lost your memory for ever. And you are definitely not fit enough for another change of personality. Alas, even my knowledge of magic has its limits.

So all our hopes were in vain? We must run again?

That is a decision which only you can make. If you run, I will help you and hold the Curse in check for as long as I can. But there is another way...

To finish with the Curse once and for all!

You, At-Zako, are now strong and capable as never before. Behind you is Tka-Rik, not the weakest Magician in this world. We will challenge the Curse to come here to Gipath and meet it face to face! It will be dangerous: no words can describe the threat which the Joon Curse represents. But we do have a slight chance to conquer it, and that chance is not as small as you might think.

I will let you have ancient Joon equipment and you can infuse it with the strongest spells. And I will fight at your side when the decisive hour is upon us.

So the choice is yours - will you run, or will you fight?

The choice is simple, Tka-Rik. When I was Zak, I did not know why I risked my life so often. Now I have everything a man could ever dream of. Do you believe I would not protect my dream and my love?

You have made your choice. Prepare for the battle, At-Zako!
