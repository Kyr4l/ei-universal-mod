Well, Blondie, pity we did not meet earlier! We could have stolen a lot of nice things together, cleaned out a lot of houses!

Steal? What you mean, steal? Jeez,  I stumble over a guard in this town every five minutes!

But why go to the city? The rich have country mansions, do they not? Have you never seen one just as you leave the cave? I often thought of a bit of thievery there, but I never had the chance to do it yet.

Maybe you would like to have a look around there? There is bound to be a little coffer or two in such a rich mansion, and where there is a coffer there is usually something useful inside!
