     Occasionally, despite your efforts to avoid combat, you will encounter enemies your character must fight. Enemies do not appear on the screen until your character can see them.

     To attack an enemy place the cursor on him and, when the cursor changes into a sword, click. Your character will start fighting this enemy and will continue until the enemy dies. If the enemy is moving quickly it can be difficult to place the cursor on him, so you should use "pause" mode (<SPACE> bar).
