Bringing Sacred Flower back
To show his gratitude for the return of the Sacred Flower, the Green Clan chief of the Woodsfolk will tell you about the death of the snoop and the names of those responsible. But if you go to him without the flower, he will tell you nothing.

Find the Green Clan
Members of the Green Clan Woodsfolk live to the south of the city. East of the river which connects the Upper and the Lower lakes is a range of hills running from north to south. The Green Clan Woodsfolk inhabit the southern part of that range, on the eastern side. Do not antagonize these Woodsfolk: despite the Sacred Flower, they will fight viciously if you attack them.
