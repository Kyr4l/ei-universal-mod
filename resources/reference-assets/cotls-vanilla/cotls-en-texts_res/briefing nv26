Listen, I want to discuss a very serious matter with you. Suppose I asked you to do one thing and the Elder told you to do something very different - what would you do?

An easy question. You are the Chosen, and you've done everything right thus far. The Elder? Methinks he is a bit weird. Either he deals with Brigands, or there is this murky business about the stolen gold, or his Captain turns out to be a traitor. I do not really trust him. Or... have I said something wrong?
#DESC Still quietly and seriously. At the end a bit frightened: what if he said something stupid? After it is the Elder, such an important man...

You said everything right. And I found out that it was the Elder who has repeatedly tried to destroy me. But now I shall challenge him openly.

I see... I thought something was wrong in our village! Do not worry, Chosen. I am on your side, you can count on me and my people!
