Find the bridge
The abode of the Lizard lies north west of the area called "Sands". The road is blocked by a circular canal full of water, with two bridges across it. To avoid unnecessary danger, t'would be better to enter "Sands" from the "Dead City" side.

Neutralize the trap
There are several stone pillars on the island formed by the ring canal. An elaborate trap! The Ancient Claw given to you by the Hermit Lizard will help you pass safely.
