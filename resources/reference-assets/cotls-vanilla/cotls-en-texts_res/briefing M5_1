Listen, I  found this map in the Redhead Brigand's bag - the one who conversed with the Orc. As far as I understand it, it has to do with some object the Orcs have. Look, there is also a picture of a Seer with a key...

Well, let us have a wee look, shall we?... Aha! There is a picture of a sarcophagus with a Magic Bit in it!

Do you mean a rune?

No, runes are different. And Bits are... uhhh... Toad's breath! I don't know what they are, but when the Witch lived in the village she used to pay good money for them. And I think she will not be too mean even now, if someone offers goodies like that to her... and we split the profits!

I have not found anything yet and you talk about the splitting of profits! Look, there is a Troll here and something which looks like the entrance to a cave. Do you know where this is?

Aye, the Troll cave is to the northeast of the foothills. You can get into the cave quite easily: the Troll who guards it is big but he is so stupid, anyone could fool him. But getting further into the cave - that's another story.

Orcs are wily big devils, they are not only good fighters but they also make very clever things. Right next to the entrance to that cave there is a wee crevice with a drawbridge. I found out how it works, but I could not lower that bridge: to do that, one needs a certain small part.

Well, why not make one, then?

And who will give me the blueprint - you? Also, don't forget - each Orc tribe has their own secrets and if I had, say, a mechanism for the bridge of the Island Orcs, it would not work with the Cave Orcs' bridge.

Does that mean that Orcs of different tribes do not trust each other?

That is the point! I heard a rumor that the Island Orcs sent a Goblin party to steal a bridge mechanism from the Cave Orcs, and the Captain's people took it away from them.

 So why not try to squeeze that thing from Gort? Show him some respect, do something for him... He will be indebted to you, and all you have to do is ask for it.

The Tightfist is the Tightfist. For him, the world only consists of money and debts. Maybe the Elder is right to be suspicious about him...
