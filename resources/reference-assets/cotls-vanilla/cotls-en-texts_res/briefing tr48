You again?!  I do not know anything about the Princess! So don't even ask!

That was not my intent. I came to tell you a tale.

You are completely mad. I am a businessman and my time is money. What tales?! You must be high on mushrooms...

Why? Listen, it will not take long. Once upon a time there was a merchant. He seemed to be all right but the problem was, he was dishonest and cheated on the Governor. So it all went very well for a while but then one day...

I do not understand what you mean, young man. What cheating?

One day he lost some very important papers... Accounts. And these accounts told of all sorts of dirty tricks, all plain to see, in black and white.

So what happened next?

Next a man comes to the merchant and tells him: "You want your papers back, you tell me what I want to know". But the merchant was stupid and did not believe the man. So the papers went to the Governor that very day, and after that...

Yes, it is an interesting tale. But you sure it was only about the merchant? What about that man? Did he not complain about his health or something? You know, we live in difficult times, anything can happen...

Oh, there are many ways to tell that tale. There is also a sad ending - that man got into some serious trouble, but the point is, the Governor still got the papers. The man was not stupid enough to carry them around on his person, you see.

You repeat yourself too often: Governor, Governor! I do not like such tales, they are sad and dull. Why not tell me something better?
#ANIMATION 11

#phrase Hero  12
To do that, I will have to hear something from you first.
#ANIMATION 46

All right, ask! I want to hear a happy ending!

Tell me who robbed Valrasian. And where is the loot.
#ANIMATION 45

How could an honest man know such things? But there was a rumor that a thief by the name of Flein, whom people call Baldie, had a fit of greed...
#ANIMATION 11

Right. Could you give me more details?

What more do you want? He lives in the land of abandoned mines on a farm on the western lake shore. Their family... how should I put it... they are a disagreeable sort. They have got a sort of zoo where they tame tigers, so they are afraid of no one.

#phrase Shopper  18
These people are so unpredictable! So many times I've asked their father to come and join my guard force at the mines with his tigers. But he would not - I am no man's slave, he said! And Baldie is the family expert on domestic theft. But this time he got really bold and robbed the Governor's house! His Excellency was so upset...

Well if you sympathize with your friend so much... where is the loot now?
#ANIMATION 45

#phrase Shopper  20
At the farm of course, where else? I am sure it's all in some barn or other.
#ANIMATION 31

#phrase Hero  21
Well, thanks for your kind words. And one more thing: send that Flein a message that I want to talk to him. If you set up a meeting, you will hear the end of my tale. The happy end.
