Grey Leaf told me that all is quiet in the city. The one who allegedly recognized me would swear he saw me in a drunken dream.

Oh young man, you underestimate the forces of good! Let us suppose a citizen owns a property outside the city wall. Property which could burn or collapse at any moment. And let us further suppose hat he receives a message from the Woodsfolk. And this message kindly asks him to do or say this and not that. What citizen would refuse such a small, unimportant favor?

And if there happens to be another person who never forgets a face, he will also be asked the same thing.

Yes... You were right, esteemed Knight. All is fair in war.
