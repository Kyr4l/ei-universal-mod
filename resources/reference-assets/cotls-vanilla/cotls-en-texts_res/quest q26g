Strangers' camp
The Old Dragon saw a camp set up by some strange people to the northwest of Dead City; mayhap the Great Magician is among them. You must find that camp and ascertain all you can about these strangers.

Gain the support of the Dragon
The ghouls controlled by the Old Dragon attacked the camp of the strangers and took control of the area. But now the Old Dragon has called off his guards, so you can now make your way to the former camp.

Find the camp
The place you need is to the north-west of the mountains surrounding Dead City. If you start from the city gates, you'll have to cross the river by the bridge upstream.

Search the camp site
The camp is empty but there may be some things left behind which would tell you something about the people who set it up. For example, try searching all the dead bodies you may find.
