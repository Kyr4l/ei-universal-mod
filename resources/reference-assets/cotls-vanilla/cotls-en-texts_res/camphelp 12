Selling Items
When you are choosing things to buy in the shop, they will be put on the counter. The two top shelves of the counter hold the things you are buying, while the two bottom shelves hold the things you are selling. Use the two buttons at the bottom left-hand corner of the counter to confirm or cancel the transaction (whether buying or selling).
