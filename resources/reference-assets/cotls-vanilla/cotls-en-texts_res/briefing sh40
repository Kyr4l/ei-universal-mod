Why you come here? You are going to be very sorry-sorry! You live-live in the village, village is far, Shei-Var do not care about village. Why-why you care about Shei-Var?

It is a very simple matter: I would like you to set free the girl brought to you by the Goblins. If you want ransom, name your price!

Shei-Var do not need your ransom-ransom! We want to use that girl as ransom-ransom ourselves. A Human-Demon comes here from northern Mountains - evil, scary, catch Orc, take with him. Shei-Var was thinking-thinking and decided if Demon get girl, he be less evil.

I need-need my warrior myself. You want to show how strong you is, you open Ogre Utundry's coffer and bring me all you find in it. Kharu-Khary and Khamsy-Khamsy Orcs like Utundry because he rich. If he poor Kharu and Khamsy will listen to me - I then be rich one in Sands!

But that will be difficult-difficult: Utundry is elder-elder brother in the family, there are also twin brothers Byr and Gym.

Each Ogre has coffer-coffer, and they give keys to each other. To get Utundry's coffer you must search Byr's coffer first-first, and then look-look in Gym's coffer. You beat Utundry, you come here-here. I tell you where find Demon-Demon.
