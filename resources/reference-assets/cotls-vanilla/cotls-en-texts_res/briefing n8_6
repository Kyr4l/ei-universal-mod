Ho there! They say you are going to look for the Princess like the missing Snoop did.

And if I were? Who are you then, and why do you want to know?

My name is Mairana and I am rather good with the bow... At least I think so. If you intend to go outside the city wall often, I believe I could be of some use to you.

Why do you think so?

Well, you are obviously new here! If you were local you would not ask. Did the good Captain not tell you about the unrest in the provinces? Go a hundred paces out of the city and they will make a pincushion out of you. You know that our Ingos archers are very good marksmen!

Maybe you are right, Mairana. Indeed I somehow got the impression that the villagers around here are not especially hospitable. If I need a companion I will remember you.
