The city of Suslanger and its environs
The city which gives its name to all of the surrounding lands is located on the lake shore. Numerous irrigation canals flow from the lake. The people who work the fields are not armed, but they would certainly raise the alarm as soon as they saw a stranger -  they would be punished otherwise.
