     Information about your quests is shown in the "Quests Screen". Typically, each quest includes several missions and objectives. Some of these will be shown immediately, while others will appear only after you complete previous missions. It's not always necessary to complete all objectives in order to complete the quest successfully.

     To call up the Quests screen use the <TAB> key or click on the (currently highlighted) scroll icon in the lower-right corner. To return to the Game zone screen click on the button at the bottom of the Quests screen or press the <TAB> key again.

     Note: if the scroll icon is flickering during the game it means you have received a new quest or objective, and the Quests screen has new information for you to read. Ignore at your peril.
