Look, Chosen, here she is! Just came in as if nothing ever happened! She should thank her lucky stars that she actually managed to find out something useful, otherwise I would give her a good thrashing, the impudent scallywag! But all in good time... all right you shameless creature, tell the Chosen everything, exactly as you told me.

Well, to the north of the Middle Mountains, there is an old observatory built by the same people who built the Dead City. And there was a library there... Mayhap you can find something there which could help you enter into the city?

Are you sure about that?

Well, not really... You cannot just walk into the observatory, there are lots of Harpies there! But you can set a Dragon on them, they always fight with one another!
#DESC A bit embarrassed but then quickly recovers

Oh right, it is easy then! I will just go and fetch my tame Dragon, and everything will be just fine!

There is no need for sarcasm! That is what I was going to suggest!

Of course I cannot tame Dragons, but I saw how Lizards do it! They have a special amulet, and if the bearer of that amulet nears a Dragon, it will not attack, but instead will follow that person! But the amulet only works with one special Dragon!

And I also know where you can find the Lizard who has that amulet: he went to the old quarry in the Middle Mountains. He keeps two tame toads there - uh they are so fat and ugly...

All right, all right. Let us suppose I get that amulet. Then where do I find that special Dragon?

The Dragon lives across the lake... If you wait for winter, you can just walk across the ice... but now, in summer, t'will be awfully hard for you to find your way along the shore!

Tis you who can wait until winter, you silly goose! The Chosen can get there now - with my help, of course. To the north of Dead City is a ravine with green crystals. Crystals are closely related to ice, you know. Bring one to me and I will freeze the lake as if it were winter!

I will get the crystal!

Be still, chatterbox! I will never let you out of my sight again! Let the Chosen go and fetch that crystal - if he wants to, that is.

I see! So to get into the Dead City I need to get to the Observatory. To get into the Observatory I need a tame Dragon. To tame the Dragon I need the amulet. And to get close to the Dragon I need a green crystal... that is about the size of it, is it not? So now all is perfectly simple - just go and fetch all that stuff!
