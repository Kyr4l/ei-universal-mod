No, that is not the point.  I always thought that peons must hate their torturers, but instead of giving me help, they called the Guards and acted as if Whip-Aga and Lash-Aga were their best friends!

If you had lived here in Suslanger all your life you would not have been surprised. Peons who do not raise the alarm when they see a stranger are beaten to death - that is the law.

But now you have given me revenge upon the slavedriver brothers whom I hated and I will not remain in your debt!
