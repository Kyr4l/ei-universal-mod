As thief Sahilia says, "Show me a rich house and I will find a coffer in that house. And that coffer will not be empty!"

Find the estate
A rich estate is not the main objective of your journey. But if you happen to walk past one, why not take a look at it?

Find the coffer
The coffer must be somewhere around here... it is unlikely that they hid it at any distance....

Open the coffer
The only way to find out what is inside is to open it!
