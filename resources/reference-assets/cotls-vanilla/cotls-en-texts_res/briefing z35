Well little man, it appears you were lucky! Now shake your head and tell me what you know about the Remote Mountains, and let nothing remain untold!

Hmm, let me think... the quarry... no, that has nothing to do with it, we can forget that. But the evil Lizards in the ravine and the Khadaganian camp! I do not think I will be overjoyed to meet them!

The report mentioned the lever somewhere in the rocks east of the lake; press it and the entrance to the tunnel opens. In the tunnel itself I will be warmly welcomed by elementals and something which is "not live but moves and kills".

What did you say, laddie? Not alive but moves and kills? I know what that is, and I will tell you this, you are not in luck. Or maybe you are, it depends how it turns out.

A long time ago people could make mechanical killers, or golems.

Yes, yes, that is what the Lizard said - golems!

Those golems are formidable opponents but they obey anyone who can control them. If you learn how to switch them on and off, fine.

But the best thing is to stay away from them. All right Chosen, go now and good luck to you!
