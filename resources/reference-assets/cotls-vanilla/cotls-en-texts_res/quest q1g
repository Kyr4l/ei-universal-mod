Distract the pack
It is difficult enough to defeat the White Wolf even one to one, but if that creature has the whole pack fighting with him, it becomes almost impossible. However, you could try to distract the pack by scaring the boars to make them run. Mayhap the wolves will rush after them leaving their leader alone for a time.

Take the head of the White Wolf
The head would indeed serve as proof that the villagers now have one less enemy to worry about.
