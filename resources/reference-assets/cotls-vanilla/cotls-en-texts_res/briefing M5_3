The Orcs are not so frightening as Gort pictures them! I am surprised you never managed to scare them off yourselves.

It is not so easy, you know. The thing is, the tribe which settled in the Foothills is not all that strong, but they have a very clever Seer living with them.

He learned to control the magic pyramid - there is one right near the settlement. A funny thing really - it is an ancient device but works as good as new, damn it! So anyone who comes close to it gets a very nice lightning blast.

But if someone could kill that Seer and switch the pyramid off, the Orc tribe would start to behave themselves very quickly. But I fear that no one could fight their way through to the Seer and I know that none of our men is capable of getting there by stealth to do the job quietly with a knife.

Let us suppose I could do that.

God bless you, Chosen! If you do that I will be eternally grateful, because I do want to be able to walk around the Foothills freely. And of course I would show my gratitude in a quite tangible way - if only you could deal with the Orcs!
