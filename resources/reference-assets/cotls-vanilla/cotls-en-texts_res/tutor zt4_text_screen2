     "Pause" mode can be very useful in, for example, tight combat situations. In this mode, game time stops. You can still control the camera and issue orders to characters, but they will be carried out only after you cancel the "pause" mode. You should use this mode to assess enemies' strength, determine your targets or choose spells.

     To switch "pause" mode on or off, just use the <SPACE> bar.
