Brother Blind! I have come to discuss a serious matter with you.

May you always be blessed with the light I have been deprived of! What can I do for Brother Blondie?

How did you know I was here as well? And how do you know I am in need of something?

I am blind, not deaf. And I have not lost my wits yet.

Brother Blind can hear a rat exit its hole at the far end of the cave! And if he had a bow he could hit it with the first arrow!

#phrase Guru  6
Kind of you to say so, but I usually do not shoot at rats. There are bigger and more worthy targets. So what do you want from a poor blind man?

You were a very good teacher for many people here in the Last Shelter. Could you also train Brother Blondie here?

He-he! Here in the Last Shelter one should comply with Brother Khatul's requests even faster than the orders of a Sergeant in the Emperor's Guards! You wish to increase your dexterity, Blondie?
#DESC A bit nastily but on the whole clearly approves

Yes, willingly! But can this be achieved quickly?

I never promise impossible things. You will see for yourself!
