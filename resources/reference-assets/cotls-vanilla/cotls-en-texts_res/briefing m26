Well Chosen, you really are a wily one! You even managed to fool me with the business of that second flower! But now the Elder is finished! When I learned that you had exposed him, I danced a wee Highland fling!

That I can understand, you were always at each other's throats. But what do the people in the village say?

They say: "well done, Chosen". Do you think they were greatly enamoured of the Elder? Nothing of the kind! They kept quiet because they were afraid but now everyone will start to bring their old grudges out in the open, you'll see!.

So now they say the Chosen was sent specially to free the village from that scoundrel. But I think there could never have been any other outcome between the two of you - either you or him, and that is how it transpired!
