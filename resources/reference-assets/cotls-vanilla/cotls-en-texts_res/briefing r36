I expected you, you who is called Chosen!

Are you... do you know me?

Your unusual arrival attracted my attention, and  when you managed to peer into the Magic Orb my interest increased even more. My Dragonet accompanied you everywhere, and as far as I can tell, you noticed it too - occasionally. The closer you got to success, the more I looked forward to this meeting.

But who are you? What is your name? And if you are so powerful that you could watch me without leaving your cave, could you help me with my problems? I probably do not have to tell you about them - I am sure you know everything...

You ask too many questions too quickly, without aforethought... what if I were to answer them in the same way? However, your curiosity will be satisfied - partly.

My name would sound to you like Tka-a-Litan Rich-ty-a-Nik. An impatient person like you would probably find it somewhat long, so you may call me simply Tka-Rik. You may also add the words "Great Magician" to my name, though I have no need for such solemn title.

I could help you with your problem, but... we shall come to a certain agreement. I will also need your help.

You? A Great Magician? You joke!

Oh no, this is not the time for jokes. Everything in this world has its price, and I always pay in full. No Great Magician has a right to leave his island - so I am chained to this desolate Gipath. And that is why I need a person who can accomplish certain missions in other lands.

You will have to find and bring here two young people, a man and a girl. They, like myself, belong to a once great race of Joons, and I must... But I will tell you all that later, if you are interested. Now tell me, do you agree or not?

Hm... As if you do not know the answer. 'Course I agree!
