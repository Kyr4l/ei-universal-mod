Ogre Utundry
Shei-Var wishes to ensure that the Demon will be defeated. To prove this has indeed been done, you must bring him the contents of Ogre Utundry's coffer - he is the eldest of the three Ogre brothers who live here in Sands. After you have met with their Chief Sheivar, the Orcs will treat humans in a neutral manner. But the quest is not easy, since the Ogre brothers exchange the keys to their coffers with one another, so you will have to deal with all three!
