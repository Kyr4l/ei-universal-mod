Spells constructor
You can use keystones and runes from your inventory (and those available in the shop) to make spells. The price of the items you buy in the shop will be taken into account. You can make spells out of keystone and (optionally) runes, or you can deconstruct the spells you already have. See the lower part of the left window for details about the price of constructing/deconstructing. Use the buttons near the window to confirm or cancel.
