Right, so here is the top of the mountain, and of course there is no Magician here - no one at all, in fact. Did I come all this way and not get any closer to my goal? That is bad...

But what is that noise? It sounds like... oh no, it is... a Dragon!!!

What is that? A human? What do you want here? Maybe you wish to fight me, according to an ancient custom? I have nothing against the old traditions, although frankly I cannot see any point in it...

But I am not going to guess. It would be more fun if you tell me yourself. So?

I... uh... I did not expect to see you here, it was a mistake...

I believe you and agree with you. It is indeed a big mistake for a human to come to a Dragon's lair. But our little talk amuses me. I wonder if you could you tell me whom you expected to see here and why you came, little things like that, hmm,?

I was hoping to find the Magician whom I saw in the Magic Orb... And since the Orb comes from Dead City here, I thought... the Magician might live here too and control the skeletons who guard him!

Well, sound enough reasoning - for a human, I suppose. But you need a Magician and you found me. And you were wrong about the skeletons too: occasionally I do control them, but very rarely and then purely for fun. So what do I do with you now?

Maybe you should not do anything with me... if you do not mind, I should like to leave and never bother you again...

Alas, that is not possible. As I said, I respect old traditions, and according to them you cannot just walk away. You have overcome many  dangers and put a lot of effort into your quest. You cannot simply throw it all away.

You could challenge me to a fight, you could demand that I free a maiden, and finally you could ask me to give you a job. If you do that, I would answer any question you may care to ask. I do not happen to have any maidens in captivity at this time and I can see that you are not too keen on the prospect of a fight. So that leaves us with a job for you. Are you ready?

Is this my chance at last? The Dragon said any question I may care to ask - so I could ask him who I am and where I come from? That would be worth risking my life for!

Yes, of course. I am all ears.

This area is full of caves. A lot of disgusting creatures which people call armadillos live and procreate in these caves. When night falls, their cubs rise to the surface and even get as far as my lair up here. They make a lot of noise and fuss, they fight for morsels of food - in a word, they irritate me.

I am too huge to get into the cave, so you will go in there for me. I will give you a potion to poison the subterranean spring, so that all those who live downstream will bother me no more.

And do not leave the cave until you have killed the armadillo mother. My poison will not kill her, but it will weaken her. So even you, human, can finish her off. After that return here to me, where you may ask me a question. But think carefully before you ask, or you will regret it.

Though frankly I do not think that you could ask anything which might be really interesting.
