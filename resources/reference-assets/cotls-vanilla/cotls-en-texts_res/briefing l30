You came, human. That is good.

Is that all you wanted to tell me?

You are so hasty. I remember your questions, and I will answer them. I came to the people who wear iron to make an agreement with them. But I saw what they did to you. They do not keep their word, so I do not believe them anymore. You kept your word. So I will make you the offer.

Humans like gold. Lizards are not interested in gold. Complete the mission I give you and I will give you all the gold I have. And I have a lot of gold.

Hmmm... gold... Well, it won't do me any harm, I suppose...

But I would much rather you helped me find out where the old Magician lives, the one I have been trying to find for so long. Since the Lizards are after all an ancient people, I thought perchance you might have this information!
#CAMERA 9
#phrase OLIZ  7
You are right. Lizards are an ancient people. I can put together all the knowledge we have about the old man. Do you agree to complete my mission?

But of course! Consider it done.

Done? Are you trying to cheat me?

Actually, I was trying to make a joke, because you are too serious.
#CAMERA 9
#phrase Oliz  11
Now I see. That was a joke. Maybe I could make a joke too. Later. But now I need you to get the water back into the Canal. Orcs stole our water.

Go south along the water. You will see the dam and the canal. You must lift the dam. With a lever. I will give it to you. You must block the canal. With a rock. The rock I will not give you. It is already there on the bank of the canal. Upstream from the dam. The rock is heavy. When Orcs dug there, they spent a lot of time lifting it. Push it, and it will fall quickly.

After that return here. I will tell you everything I found out about the old Magician.

Agreed! And, by the way, if you add a few coins to your tale I will not be offended at all.
#CAMERA 9
#phrase Oliz  15
For coins go to my fellow Lizards who live on the shallows farther south. Cross over to the most remote sand island, the third one. The treasure will be yours!

Strange. That man likes humor. I made a joke. The man did not smile. Very strange.
