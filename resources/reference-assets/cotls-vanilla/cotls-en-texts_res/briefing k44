So, my dear fellow, did you manage to find something yet, or did you only find trouble for yourself?

I really cannot boast! I've spent all my money and all for nothing. I am afraid I must look for work soon. Would you by any chance know if Karansul needs people to work in his mines?

Maybe he does, young man. Recently he installed a mechanical grinder at his site - I remember I gave him Guards to secure the delivery.

So now Karansul needs knowledgeable people to look after that machine, because as soon as anything goes wrong with it everyone stops work and rushes to see what happened. They do not move from the spot and chatter the whole time it takes to fix it...

So maybe, my dear fellow, you could learn to handle it! If not to fix it, then at least to break it, ha-ha!

Hm... Maybe I should try that... The more people come to the broken machine, the more chances I will have to sneak to the foreman's house unseen!
