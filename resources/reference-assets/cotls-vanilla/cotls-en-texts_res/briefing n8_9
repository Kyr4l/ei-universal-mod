I am sorry... You are not Brissen the Good Knight by any chance? I heard about you in the city but I was told you were dead!

Ah, the rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated. It is just that some people would very much like that to be true, so every time I leave the city area for any length of time talk about my death starts anew. But I always return, because I am still a servant of good, not evil!

And by the way, young man! I am glad to make your acquaintance. Grey Leaf told me about you and your quest. I think you are on the side of good too, so we can travel together. Think about my words!
