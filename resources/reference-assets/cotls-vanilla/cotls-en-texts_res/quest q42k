Finding the city
You must come to the city in order to look for the girl in Ingos. The main landmarks here are the two lakes, upper and lower, connected by the river. You will find the city somewhere to the north of the upper lake.

The village of the Woodcutters
To get to the city whence you were teleported, first go south and pass through the small village of the Woodcutters. They are hostile towards all strangers, so you have two choices....either slip past the village stealthily or start a fight with the villagers. Afterwards, turn east and go along the narrow ravine.

The bridge and the village of the hunters'
To the north of the bridge across the river lies a village inhabited by hunters; like the Woodcutters, the hunters will attack any stranger. To enter the city, cross the bridge and leave the village behind.

Come to the city
The city is located to the north of the upper lake. It is surrounded by an old fortress wall, so you can only enter the city through the gates in the eastern wall.
