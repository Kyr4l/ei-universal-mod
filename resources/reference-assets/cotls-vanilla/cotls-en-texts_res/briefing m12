Golden Valley is a famous place. I wanted to visit it myself a while ago...

Did you? The Elder told me that no one but he himself knew the way.

He lied, as always. Many people went there.

Yes I did say that, and I do not deny it. But I do not remember saying that any of them returned here. No wait, that is not strictly true! One of them did return, but he was completely brainless.

He babbled something about skeletons - supposedly they were guarding the gold and detected people not by their eyes, but by some special sense... so upon reflection I decided I did not want to go there, after all. Better leave the gold to Orcs than lose my own head!

Aha! Something must be wrong here. If Babur himself was afraid to go after that gold, some really nasty surprises must be in that ravine. Maybe I should tell the Elder to forget about it?
