     This is the screen you will use to equip your characters with clothes, weapons, potions, wands, etc. The name of the different characters are displayed on a panel on the left side of the screen. You can "flip" through the list of characters using the buttons to the left and right of the name panel.
     The bar at the top of the screen shows what items the character will take with him into the Game zone. The four slots on the left are for weapons, while those on the right are for potions and wands.

     The bottom bar shows your characters' "inventory". These are the items they will not be taking into the Game zone. If you want only certain types of items displayed, use the buttons to the left and right of the bar. To see what types of items a button will display, just place the cursor over it and leave it there for a few seconds. A pop-up tip will appear with the information.

     As explained above, items are either "held" actively by the character (top bar) or put in inventory (bottom bar). To move items from your inventory to the character, just click on the item in the inventory (bottom) bar and it will move to the active (top) bar. To select an active weapon for use, simply right-click on its picture in the top bar. A frame will appear around it. Now it's ready to use. To put an active item into your inventory, click on the item's picture in the top bar.

     Note: If all slots in the upper bar are empty, your character will go into the Game zone unarmed - and probably not make it out in one piece! Also, this is the only screen from which you can equip your character.
