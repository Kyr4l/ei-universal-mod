Look, Chosen... I was thinking... It is not right. I am the Captain, but you have beaten up the Goblins. Bad for my prestige. Could you... sort of... say that it was mostly my doing, and that you just... sort of helped me out, hmm? And I would make it worth your while, of course.

All right, all right, I am not ambitious. But in return I will ask something from you. They say you have got a bridge mechanism which the Goblins stole from the Cave Orcs? You do not really need it, but I could use it.

Ha, it turns out our Chosen is really a village idiot! I thought he would ask for something serious, but that mechanism is worthless. Looks like his friend Babur did not teach him to bargain properly!
