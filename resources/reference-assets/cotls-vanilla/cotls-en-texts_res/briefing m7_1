Did you hear that? They say GoGo himself came to our Silvertongue to negotiate! Now do you see it is not me but him who deals with Goblins? I am sure Erfar is plotting another dirty trick against me!

Be still, those talks have absolutely nothing to do with you. GoGo came and he will go.

Go? What do you mean, go?! We cannot let him go, man! He has a meteorite stone in his eye, that is an incredibly valuable thing! You must cut his throat and bring that stone to me. And I will give you... uhh, well, we will certainly agree on the price.

Oh no, friend. The Elder and I have other plans for that Goblin.

Oh, so that is how it is now, is it? "The Elder and I", you say? In that case do not call me "friend". Apparently we have different friends, you and I.
