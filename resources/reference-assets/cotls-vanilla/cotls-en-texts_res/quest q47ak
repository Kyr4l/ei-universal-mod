Find the military camp
To find the military camp where the spy lives, first go from the city suburbs to the abandoned mines area, then go east. The camp is located in the valley between two hills. Both entrances to the valley are fenced and guarded, but the southern one is guarded more intensively than the northern one.

Find the spy
Try looking for him near his barrack which is located in the western part of the camp near the hillside. Remember that in the south-eastern area of the camp there is a shooting range where archers train, so you better avoid it.
