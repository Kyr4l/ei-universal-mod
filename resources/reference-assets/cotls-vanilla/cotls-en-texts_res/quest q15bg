Making peace with the Lizards
To prevent the Middle Mountain Lizards from attacking humans, you must return the Big Shell to the altar. The altar is near the start of the passage to the lake, east of the location where the dry riverbed starts in the rocks. The passages between the hills leading there are guarded by groups of Lizards, so it will prove difficult by direct route. Note!! Until you have completed this quest, the road to the observatory will prove very dangerous.

Get to the altar
It is best for you to try to go between the hill and the dry riverbed: the guard force is weakest there. After you are cross the hills on the Lizards' territory, be very careful: mayhap you should crawl while you are there.

Put the shell back in place
You must return the large shell to the altar. After that Lizards will attack humans no more. But if people attack them first, hostilities will begin anew.
