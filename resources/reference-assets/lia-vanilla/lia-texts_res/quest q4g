Samples from Gipath
In the packet of orders for the expedition, it says that you must give the messenger stone samples from the Dead City mines. If traces of precious stones are found in these ores, a new expedition will be sent to Gipath. This must not happen, so the samples must be obtained in another mine, where there must be no precious stones.
