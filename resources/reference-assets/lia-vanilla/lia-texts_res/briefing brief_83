It doesn't matter. Karim is not to blame for this. The most important thing is that we now have a documentary.

In the midst of various things it is said here that '... after the robbery of the estate of the unknown being, a careful investigation of the circumstances of the incident was carried out, the result of which was that immediately prior to the robbery a spell of teleportation and transmutation had been cast, as indicated by the shard of the amulet triggering the spell.

From the shard found, it was possible to determine that the teleported object was aimed at the Useless Lands. Based on the fact that among the corpses found, none resembled those of the red-skinned young man, it was concluded that he had been teleported.' I must get to the Useless Lands immediately!

That's okay, I'll figure something out. I'll join the army and that way I can get access to the portal!
