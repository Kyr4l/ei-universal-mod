Assault of the isthmus of Doukhov
The area of Dwurzeczama is of great strategic importance. The Khadagans have not yet had time to regroup and renew their forces after the loss of Dar-Ugorn, so you can try to build on the success and take the isthmus.

Reach the bridge
The collection point for the troop to undertake the task has been determined to the east of the southern bridge.
#subobj 2
Eliminate the sentry

Destroy the protection of the isthmus
