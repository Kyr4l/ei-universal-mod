Soldiers! Do not forget that you are on duty in the most valiant army! And the service sends you to distant lands. It is cold and damp there, and you will meet savages and wild animals. Life there will prove to be harsh and full of dangers for you. But all because of the power of our Empire! Remember this, and your service will be lighter.
