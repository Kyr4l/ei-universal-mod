Lord Baron, we have captured the necromancer who is to blame for the appearance of the undead in the area. He lived on Death Island, in an old tower.

Well how dare he on my land create such mischief! Answer: who are you and how did you get to that island?

#phrase Nekro 3
My lord, your humble slave call Jamanin, I am a humble follower of the school of theoretical necromancy. I have long since settled in a tower to deal with my experiences away from everyone.

So your experiences are over. Now you are in my power, I will have you punished with death to end your defilement.

I dare you to beg for mercy! My death will do no good, but alive I will be far more useful.

And what use is a corpse-eater to us?

Surely the necromancer is right. We'll always have time to condemn him to death, and if he's willing to cooperate before that - he can be of use to us.

#phrase Nekro 8
My merciful Lord! At your feet please grant me life. I swear to serve you and use my knowledge for your benefit and to the detriment of your enemies.

Don't count on being pardoned. For now I dismiss your execution. But if you serve both me and Cania faithfully, you will regain your freedom.
