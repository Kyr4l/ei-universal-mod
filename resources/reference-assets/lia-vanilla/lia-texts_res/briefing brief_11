No, it's not all over yet. I still attract too much attention because of my skin color. Something needs to be figured out, and the sooner the better.

Yes, you have to think. Hm... There is one measure... The venom of Prettnotulius sackbutus has been shown to affect the color of the skin, turning it gray, but in doing so it causes convulsions or paralysis of the limbs. Well, every remedy has side effects, you understand. But in my opinion it would be useful to give up this remedy and come up with something else...
