Fellow Trickster, for Kiel you have shown yourself to be a man experienced in certain matters. So tell me: why would a governor send an empty trunk to the capital as a gift, and protected by a squad of soldiers?

Ha, a wench came to me for advice? Pleasant, pleasant... And about the empty trunk, the governor might not have known. After all, he didn't personally send this caravan. Now such matters are handled by old Hys, all cleaned up for himself, slyly.

Aha! Yeah, that means it could be Hys's doing...

You're so clever, but you think slowly. The caravan was ambushed on this road. Now do you understand?

You mean Hys could have cleaned up that nugget...

... and then play out the caravan robbery, that they supposedly robbed it. All basic.

Hm. I knew Hys wasn't a very nice guy, but to rob the governor... Yeah, he could do it. But he could and he didn't. Karansul has his hands all over the place, too. I'll have to think about it.
