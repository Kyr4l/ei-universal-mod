     Right in the center of the screen is a portrait of your character dressed in the armor he will wear in the Game zone. Wearing the right armor plays a key role in the success or failure of your quest. The slots to the left and right of the portrait show the pieces he is currently wearing. If you place the cursor over a slot you'll see the name and properties of the armor piece displayed in the right screen panel.

    Armor is divided into light and heavy category. Heavy armor can be put on top of light armor to give additional protection. Be advised that the more you weigh your character down, the slower he will be.

     Click on armor in the inventory bar to put it on your character. It will appear immediately on the character's portrait and its icon will show up in the appropriate slot.
     To take a piece of armor off your character, click on the slot containing the piece's icon. The armor will return to inventory.

     The left screen panel shows the details for all the protective gear your character is wearing. Your character now has a total attack and defense "value", and a certain amount of potential to inflict damage. These amounts are displayed below the total property value and depend on what the character is wearing, as well as his skills with the selected weapon and the weapon's details.

    To learn more about the properties of a given weapon, place the cursor over the weapon and let it remain there a few seconds. A full description of the weapon will show up in the right screen panel.
