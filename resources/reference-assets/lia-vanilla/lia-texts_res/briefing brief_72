Now I am ready to tell you the important news. You asked me about the Joons. Well, some time ago a man came to our caves. He did not ask our permission to stay here. He started destroying the walls, scratching at them with some tools. He was looking for things the Joons had left behind when they left this land. We frightened him and drove him out.
