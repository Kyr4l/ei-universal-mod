Do you know the Witch Esther? Because you see, she has become terribly mean and spiteful in her old age, even those she saves run away from her! Ha, ha, ha!

Well, she once met a man in the wilderness who came to Gipath with these people from a faraway land. And the orcs slaughtered them all, and before they did, he went away, and Esther found him and took him in. And then he ran away from her! They say he has now settled in the Distant Peaks.

If this man is a member of the expedition and is still alive, he could be dangerous. After all, he could try to return to Suslanger! That must not be allowed to happen!
