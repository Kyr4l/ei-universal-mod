Peace with the lizards
Hermit the Lizardman asks you to place the Great Shell on the Altar of the Lizardmen in Distant Peaks in order to reconcile them with the humans who have been raiding the Lizardmen's territory a lot lately. In return, Hermit agreed to tell how to find the Chosen One.

Come to the altar
The lizard area is located to the west of the Ogle Peaks. The altar, on the other hand, is in the very center of it, and is well protected.

After the Shell is placed on the Altar, there will be peace in the Distant Peaks.
