Ulka, what's that thing around your neck like that? A key or something? I haven't seen that on you before.

And I don't know. I found it somewhere in the mountains. It seemed to me that this is a magic object, so I decided: let it drive away evil forces from me, and maybe it can scare away lizards! But it is a burden for me, for it pulls my neck so terribly, brings me closer to the ground.

I think I saw a lock somewhere that opens with this key.

Sell me that key. It's no use to you, and I've still got a long way to go, so maybe it'll come in handy somewhere.

Why not sell? I'll sell, of course.
