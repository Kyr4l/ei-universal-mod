And lo and behold, our heroes are back! Congratulations. I thought you guys were gonna get captured.

I don't know how to say this. The thing is, I didn't bring a nugget.

What do you mean you didn't bring it?! Where did you put it?

I didn't put it anywhere! It just wasn't in the trunk!

What, you decided to fool us? You're gonna regret this!

Geraldine, wait. Let's think about this. If the boy wanted to deceive us, why would he come back? Apparently he's telling the truth: the trunk was empty. It was Valrasian who tricked us.

And that's what I'm talking about! There was nothing in the trunk. How was I supposed to bring you what wasn't there!

Okay, not nice to say, you stood the test. Though I don't understand where the nugget went.

We'll deal with the nugget later. Most importantly, these guys are not spies. Oh sorry! A boy - and a girl. :)
