Oh, how quickly you came back! Did you bring it? You know, a decent girl can't live without a comb and a mirror! And other little things like that.

So I went there for the comb and mirror? Is that what got Kiel killed!

Kiel... is that the burly girl who kept an eye on you? Hm, I feel sorry for her, of course. But I couldn't leave my comb there! It's made of real dragon bone!

A comb and a mirror... Kiel! You had a hunch! You wanted to leave! What a fool I am. Fool! I didn't notice anything!

NO! Get away from me! Your beauty is poisoning! You don't measure up to her. She was devoted to me, she was the closest thing to me!

No, I will not leave her death unforgiven. I feel a double force within me! Jygran will find out what the Wrath of Joon is!
