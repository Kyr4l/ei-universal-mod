Urk-Tar
The orc chieftain and his two young warriors went hunting a long time ago and have not returned yet. You have to find them, most likely the orcs got into trouble.
#subobj 1
Find the orc troop
Urk-Tar should have led the hunters to the east, to an area rich in game.
#subobj 2
Drive away the harpy
Apparently, the harpy living in this area has set a flock of bats on the troop. The orcs won't be able to get through on their own, they need help.
#subobj 3
Kill the bats
The way to the ward is blocked by bats that the harpy has bitten. The way should be cleared!
#subobj 4
Escort the leader to the fortress
Urk-Tar has been wounded. He will now need an escort to reach the tribe.
#subobj 5
Urk-Tar must survive
The death of the chief will mean the end of the tribe.
