Gipath
Gipath - a neglected land not belonging to a single state. Much of the land is wilderness. Goblins, orcs and lizardmen can be found here, although there are also two small human settlements in the western part of the continent. Almost all of Gipath is littered with the ruins of buildings left behind by the long lost Joon race. It is said that this world was the site of a meteorite fall, for which a Khadagan expedition was sent in search.
