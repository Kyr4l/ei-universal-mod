Brother Kir, in sending you on this assignment I never thought I'd see you alive again! He, he, he. But verily, this is the strangest thing I have ever seen in my life. Your return and successful deliverance of us from the threat that hung over the Last Sanctuary proved that the Great Powers are in our favor!
