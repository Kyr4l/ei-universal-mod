I got your message. And I've already heard about an old mage that they want to hang him for murdering a knight. It's ridiculous to even think about it, that such an old man could slaughter a grown knight!

Well, that's the thing, he didn't kill Brissen! And I want to prove it. The Governor has given me time to investigate, but I need to hurry.

Jam-Akara said he went to the mines that day.

Uh... That's right. An old man came by the mine the other day. He had an outdated permit, but it's nothing if he hangs around there, it won't be any worse for anyone. He's a funny old man, he helped my village...

Aha. I put a stamp on his old permit that he'd gone to the mine. But when he came back, the permit was gone. He dropped it somewhere. But I was running out of duty, so I let him go anyway.

That means the permit is still in the mines somewhere! This paper will help me justify Jam-Akara!
