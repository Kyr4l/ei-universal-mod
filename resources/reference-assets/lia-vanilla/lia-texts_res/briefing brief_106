Yeah, all that's left is to get it all back to that dilapidated cabin in the Dead City. The sergeant told us they use it to relay reports.

Thank you Kiel for then suggesting where to pick the stone samples from. I wouldn't have guessed without you. You're my best friend, although I have to admit I never had friends before.

A friend, a friend! Why does he only see me as a friend! I followed him to this Gipath forgotten by everyone just to be near him and he won't notice any of it!

Be that as it may, for a pleaser like you Kiel will invent more than one good idea. That's what friends are for.
