My blood is already boiling! Ah, to get to Firez faster... but he's settled in his fortress. Damn!

And Firez isn't the only one you'd like to reach. The Baron has already given me an assignment to gather information about Firez's castle. I'm just preparing my spy network.

How's that gonna work out for you? In the end, look where you are and where Firez is.

Didn't I already tell you I'm selling my rachatlum and sorbets to Firez's palace? He won't be eating it himself, but his many loved ones, namely his wife and children, simply adore my sweets.

But it's not simple, of course. But if approached with due skill and ingenuity, it makes the task simpler. I always carefully develop a plan and then follow it.

So you don't have to doubt. We'll soon know what Firez is having for breakfast, what the journeyman in the kitchen is gossiping about, and which soldier got shot in the eye in the last fight.
