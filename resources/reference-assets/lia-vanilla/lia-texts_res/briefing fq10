It's quiet on Gipath somehow. Don't you think?

Come on! How quiet? There's so much going on here! I just found out that on the islands they keep orcs and goblins captive, and force them to work!

But the worst part is, they've taken Go-Go himself captive! He sits in a cage with them, like a wild animal. If Go-Go were free, he would punish those nasty orcs.

After all, he's so brave! So smart! He certainly became a leader for a reason, and he certainly knows how to speak beautifully. And, I'm told - not a peep from anyone - that he's insanely pretty, for a goblin.

Too bad he's sitting in captivity, that's how I don't even get to see him.

Pretty goblin? Something doesn't want me to believe that. But go and look at him.... By the way maybe we'll set him free too.
