Pane Governor, your court mage told us you wanted to see us. Is there anything we can do for you?

Fortunately, you can't be of any use to me. For the simple reason that I need nothing from you. But the rules of good manners require that when you arrive in town, you introduce yourselves to the governor.

Sorry, Governor. But I always thought that a man of such high rank as yours would not show favor to acquaint himself with simple travelers.

I hold rather liberal views and have nothing to do with intercourse with simple people.

And what a beautiful face next to you! And you have hidden such a lovely creature from me! Do you travel in this man's company, my child? Is this your... ehm... fiancé?

Kir is the closest person to me. But not a fiancé.

How lucky! This is, I wanted to say - wouldn't you like to get acquainted with my collection? We could get to know each other better.

#phrase Hero 8
There are legends about your exquisite collection! They say you have collected every rare specimen that can be found on this earth.

And not just on this one! Unfortunately, I can't boast of owning the arrow of the forest people mage from the Blue Clan. And she would have embellished my collection in such a bizarre way!

Mr. Governor, it will be a great honor for you to bring you this arrow. Especially since we owe you something, having failed to show you due respect upon your arrival in town.

You better get out of here as soon as possible. I don't like the way this governor is looking at me....
