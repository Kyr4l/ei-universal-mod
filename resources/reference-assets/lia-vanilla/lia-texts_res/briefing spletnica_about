And here, get acquainted, Ula. We call her Uszasta, because she hears everything. A toad in the Ruins will hum, and the Hive will hear. And then she tells everyone about it. Sometimes she says useful things. In return we help her run the farm. Because she lives alone and it's hard for her. Right Ulka?

What have I heard? I didn't hear anything. Only the goblins in the watchtower said that the Magic Mushroom grew in the Middle Peaks. And they say that the Chosen One himself found the White Flower there. And now the mushroom has grown! They say no one has ever seen such a big mushroom on Gipath. It sure is tasty.
