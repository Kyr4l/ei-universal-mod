Explorers
The Khadagans have tried to explore caves many times before, and this time they want to explore the caves where the Last Hideout is located. One of the researchers has just been spotted at the cave!

Catch up with the scout
You must catch up with the scout researcher before he can tell the others about his find!

Return to the cave
Apparently the scout has already managed to report back to his group about what he found, and now a whole group of researchers and their bodyguards are marching to the Last Hideout. With a crowd like that, it's better not to argue.

Destroy the enemy squad
The explorers heading for the caves were expecting to encounter at worst a few oversized rats, but in no case a squad of Last Hideout inhabitants ready to fight!

Kill the scout
Although the khadagans already know about the cave, you need to teach the scout a lesson.
