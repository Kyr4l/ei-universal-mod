     Your main character (or hero) doesn't have to travel alone. On every island he can find people in some Dialog zones who will agree to accompany him on his quests. They won't demand any money for this - they join his team for their own reasons. It's easy to determine who is interested in joining - they'll tell you so during your first conversation.

     Note: If one of your companions dies, it doesn't mean the game is over. However, keep in mind that many game quests are designed to be completed by a strong team. Doing them alone will be much more difficult, so keep your team alive!

     You can change your companions' armor and weapons just as you do for your main character. Your companions will also gain experience during adventures, and you'll be able to invest this experience in new skills and abilities. However, when the hero moves on to another island he must leave his team behind.
     The team cannot have more than three characters in it. If you ask a fourth character to join the team, he'll find some reason to refuse.
     You can dismiss a team member you wish, in the zone in which you found him/her. You can take him back late if the situation calls for it.
