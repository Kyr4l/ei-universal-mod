You told me that there are humans living on Gipath as well, but I haven't seen any so far.

We fight. The people of the Village-Village attacked the orcs on the Foothills. A second village was created. The orcs are gone. Only the hunters remain.

Also people-people, but they live not with them, but with orcs they make friends.

Not allowed. The people in the Middle Peaks have come-come. The orcs continue to drive them out. They must be stopped.

And what do you propose? That I should fight against the people?

No. First- first the Shell must be stolen. If the Shell is gone, the lizard-people will attack the humans. The humans will become weak, the orc-orcs will drive them from the Middle Peaks.

Fine, I'll steal that Shell, just don't hope I'll help you fight against the humans. After all, I'm human too.
