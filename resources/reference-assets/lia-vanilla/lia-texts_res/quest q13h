Beloved
Fieruza's fiancée, Aliya, was caught stealing and thrown into a cell in a small fortress in the necromancer desert. She is soon moved to a larger prison which is much better protected. Fieruz has asked all his friends and help to free his bride while it's still happening.

Kill the guard
The gate of the fortress is protected by a sentry. He must be carefully removed or he will raise the alarm.

Open the gates
The rest of the participants are waiting for the opening of the passage to get inside the fortress.

Break through to the prison
There are still a few guards in the fortress, so it falls to you to run past the fight. The entrance to the prison opens with a lever.

Run!
Apparently reinforcements are about to arrive for the guards. It's high time to take your legs!
