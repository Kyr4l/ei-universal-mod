Judging by the map, the entrance to the catacombs is just ahead.

Something doesn't appeal to me about this map.... And these dark, murky catacombs. Maybe there is another passage here?

Kiel! You're scared! I would never have believed, much less after such a daring escape, that you would be scared of what.... the dark?!

I am afraid of what! Kiel is not afraid of anything! It's just that you can't see anything in the dark, and that makes me sick. And anyway: who knows what awaits us there?

Don't worry. We'll get in there and then we'll find out, and in the process we'll get a little further away from the guards.
