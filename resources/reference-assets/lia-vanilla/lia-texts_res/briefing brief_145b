That's good. I hope you won't deny me now in a request. I brought you the knife of the Chosen One.

The key to the gate in the gorge that stretches along the lake in the Middle Peaks, could you make? I found the Magic Bullet, and it's broken. It is necessary to go to the ruined observatory, and maybe there I will find some means to do it.

Well if you say it's essential with this observatory, I'll help. I have a spare key for that gate. After all, those gates have been there for a long time. So I decided to get myself a key just in case. I thought it might come in handy someday. And here it is!

Thank you Babur. Now I can find the means to repair the bullet.
