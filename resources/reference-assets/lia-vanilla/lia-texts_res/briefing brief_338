Ah, dreams... When you are young, you dream of personal happiness. My aspirations, on the other hand, are directed only to the flourishing of my land and the prosperity of my people. By defeating the hated Firez and his necromancy, I will turn Jygran from a dying land into a rich and flourishing one!

I hope that the sealing spell will disappear with the death of this villain, and then Jygran will open up to the world. And we won't be needy anymore, oh no! We ourselves will be able to offer help!
