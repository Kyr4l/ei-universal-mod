Letter to the blackmailer
Aunt Zara wants to make an arrangement with her blackmailer regarding a ransom for his silence. You need to carry the note with her offer to the discussed location north of the plantation.

Leave the city area
Now that the chaos following the appearance of the Curse near the Portal has subsided to some extent, the guards have removed protection from the bridges so it is now perfectly safe to exit the city.
#subobj 2
Get to the agreed place
Lots of dangerous wildlife lives outside the city area, and the caretakers on the plantations are doubly dangerous.
#subobj 3
Free yourself from the spies
The place turned out to be watched. The spies are not expected to survive.
#subobj 4
Return the letter
The letter needs to be put in the urn. The blackmailer will take it later.
