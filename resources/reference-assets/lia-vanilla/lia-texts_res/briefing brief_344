Ah, our hero has visited me. So tell me: how did everything go? Did you save the relatives?

Thank you, everything went great. You helped us a lot.

Why are you so unhappy? That's not appropriate. Eat a doughnut, it'll make you feel better.

But I don't need to make myself feel better. Better tell me where to find the cyclops and the dragon.

#phrase Doctor 5
Oh, and you can't do it yourself? The cyclops lives in the mountains to the north between two rivers. And there are enough dragons on the Isle of Death.

But the thing is, after my time on this island, there are no more dragons! And I really need one! You know what I mean? Very much!

#phrase Hero 7
I must force the Baron to fortify the citadel. But without strong allies, he won't agree to it. With the Tui-Lena amulet, I will subdue the dragon and cyclops, and they will fight on our side.

Well, if that's the case, it changes things. Look for the dragon in the northern mountains, where the river flows out. They always settle in the mountains next to the water.
