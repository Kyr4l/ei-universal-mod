Mr. Governor, allow me to present you with a Blue Clan magician's arrow.

Beautiful, beautiful! And I had no doubt you would bring it to me! Admit it, it wasn't that hard.

When I was your age, I could have collected a hundred of these arrows. I remember like yesterday: arrows are wheezing around me, and I'm standing, so beautiful and tall, and I'm leading my soldiers behind me on these people of the forest.

Ah Mr. Governor, you are such a hero! Thanks to your actions, life on Ingos has definitely started to get a lot safer! That's why I don't understand why the mine district is closed.

My child, why do you bother your pretty head with such foolishness? You can go to the mine district, but only with permission, which I write out personally. But believe me, there's nothing interesting there!

Only this eccentric type, Jam-Akara, goes there. I don't even understand what he's looking for there.

Governor, now that you've remembered him... he's asked you to write him a new permit.

Ah, what a cliché.... but so be it. I'll write him a new permit. But this is the last time! I'm getting tired of him walking my grounds.
