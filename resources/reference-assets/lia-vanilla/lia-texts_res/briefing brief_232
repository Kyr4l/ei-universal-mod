This is simply outrageous! Murder happened on my land! At least it's a good thing none of my subjects suffered. That old rebel Brissen deserved to die like that.

And his friend was no better! He pretended to be such a seemingly harmless maverick, but in reality he turned out to be a common murderer! But he shouldn't have done it on my soil after all. This is unforgivable! I will judge him with all severity.

Governor! The old mage may not be a murderer! It's just impossible.

All the clues speak for themselves. A message written by Jam-Akara's hand was found with Brissen, in which he sets his friend to meet at the very place and time they killed him. So what is this if not proof of guilt?

Governor, after all, you said yourself that you uphold liberal views. Please let my colleague conduct an independent investigation.

Ah lovely child, what can you know about politics? But so be it. I'll even let you talk to the arresting officer.
