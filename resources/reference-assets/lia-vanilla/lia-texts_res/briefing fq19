If it will benefit me, that would be pretty good.

Where people have dug deep burrows in the mountains, I saw one man drop this key. It is very important, as is the man who lost it. The man was so weak that he wobbled when he walked, but he tried to hold on, so he kept singing all this time.

And when he fell and could not get up for a long time, his friends came and took care of him by carrying him in their arms. And that's when he lost that key. I'm sure this key is from something secret.

I hope this turns out to be true. Thank you, Habbur, for the key. I will dutifully look for the lock that it opens.
