Kir, from what I understand there is a Portal leading to Suslanger somewhere. Tell me how to get to it, I want to go home.

How? I mean... why now? I don't understand it. Why so suddenly?

Well, as it seems to Kiel, here the thing smells like a wedding, and I hate weddings.

But what kind of wedding? I can't even get my hopes up for that. She's so pretty, and I... she's never noticed me.

Believe me, fool, she's going to behave in a completely different way towards you now. But Kiel doesn't want to see that. Therefore, tell me how to get to the Portal.

Kiel, please don't go away. I'm so used to you being close! I can't imagine what it would be like without you. And just so you know, we have one more adventure ahead of us. Tai-Ilara asked me to bring her things she couldn't take.

Ah... well... for the sake of her bullshit you're willing to put your head in the noose without hesitation. Eh, if Kiel doesn't watch you this time too, it's gonna be bad...

But I feel this will be our last adventure together. After it, our paths will part. I won't need you much longer and I can go home.
