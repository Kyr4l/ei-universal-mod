A gift for Airy
Airy, the lovely granddaughter of a witch dreams of trying on a necklace worn by the clairvoyant of the cave orcs. It's hard to deny the joy of giving her such a gift, so you have to get this necklace.
#subobj 1
Get to the orc camp
The only free tunnel in the cave leads to the orc camp.
#subobj 2
Get the necklace
Killing the clairvoyant won't be easy. It would be much quieter to steal the necklace.
#subobj 3
Leave the cave
The clairvoyant will soon notice the theft and raise the alarm. It's better to get a little further away from here before that happens.
