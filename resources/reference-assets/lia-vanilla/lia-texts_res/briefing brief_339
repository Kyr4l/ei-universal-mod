We've bounced down the isthmus, now it's a stone's throw to Firez. Soon you'll meet your family.

Yeah, I've thought about that before. They are out there, on the other side, somewhere in the cathedrals. And they don't know how close their freedom is! As long as they're still alive, of course...

Don't think about it. You'll save them.

Damn! You don't even realize how hard it is to get through to the prison! Firez protects the Joons too thoroughly. I then just miraculously managed to escape!

Kir, I don't recognize you. You went all the way so boldly, and now you're afraid of something? That's just stupid! And also, you forgot that Kiel is with you. And while you were indulging in empty ruminations, I made a plan for you.

At my request, Uncle Rada obtained information about the Joon captives. And listen to what he found out: Firez, fearing a Canian attack, will move all the Joons from the mountain prison to himself in a fortress!

At what point do you think it would be best to stage an escape?

We'll attack the caravan on the way! That's the easiest way. Kiel! You're great! When this is all over, I'm gonna kiss you! What would I do without you?! Thank you. :)

Agreed. Just don't forget that you promised Kiel to kiss her. Because she will remember, and wait.
