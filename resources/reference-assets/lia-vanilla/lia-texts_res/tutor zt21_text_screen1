     You can inflict much greater damage on your enemy if you catch him by surprise and strike him from behind (we call this a "backstab"). But the hit will be counted as a "backstab" only if the enemy didn’t notice you. This means you must get close to him without being noticed. Use the Sneak mode for this.

     This technique is especially suitable for enemies stronger than your character, such as the white wolf.
