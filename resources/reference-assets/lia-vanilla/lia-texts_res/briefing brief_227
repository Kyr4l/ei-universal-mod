Just great. First he scolded us for not arriving sooner, then he started courting me, and finally he forced a gift on us for him. All in all, we fell out wandering into the woods people for some dang arrow!

Kiel, you're wrong. The Governor has shown us great honor, we should be grateful to him.

Let's hope after these words from Kiel Hys doesn't run to tell the governor about everything. Then we wouldn't be out of trouble.

As a rule, it's the combined forces of the city garrison and Karansul security that protect the caravans. Admittedly, last time they came to do without Karansul's services.

Who ordered the second line of security to be taken off the caravan? One of the two of them, Hys, or Karansul.
