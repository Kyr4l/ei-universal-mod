What is the phrase-password you need to say to the trader? ... Ah, I remembered.

#phrase Hero 2
Trader, I need to buy twenty baskets of cinnamon cookies immediately.

#phrase Doctor 3
There are none with cinnamon, but there are with sweet pumpkin, and not twenty but only eight. Can it be?
#ANIMATION 17

#phrase Hero 4
It could be. My name is Kir.

#phrase Doctor 5
I'm Uncle Council. Are you sent by the Baron?

#phrase Hero 6
No, Craftsman Stark. Meanwhile, the Baron is busy, settled in his fortress and fending off attacks from the Celestials.

#phrase Doctor 7
The situation is getting more and more difficult, even more so if you don't try to fix it. And sitting in a fortress won't help much. But what brought you to me?

#phrase Hero 8
The whole neighborhood has been overrun by corpses. We're destroying them everywhere we meet them, but more and more are mowing down every time!

#phrase Doctor 9
Yeah, hard... You want a donut? No. Let me tell you this: when your sugar burns, there's no need to rush to scrape it out of the bottom, first you need to take the pot off the heat. Get it?

#phrase Doctor 10
Dead people don't just rise from their graves. You have to look for a necromancer.
#ANIMATION 5

#phrase Hero 11
But where to find him? He could be anywhere!
#ANIMATION 61

#phrase Doctor 12
It's obvious you're not local. There's an island nearby called the Island of Death. And on it a necromancer has long since settled. Only the Baron has no business being there, he's only busy protecting the borders of his estate.

#phrase Hero 13
So you need to capture the necromancer as soon as possible and force him to pacify the graveyards!
