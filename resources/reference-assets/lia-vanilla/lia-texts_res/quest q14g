Babur's Return
The Village Blacksmith, Babur Tightfist, should know a lot about magical items. He may have heard of the Magic Bullet, too. In addition, the Highwaymen need a new blacksmith, as the old one is no good at all. You have to persuade or force the smith to come to the village of the Free Hunters.

Get to the Village
The village is the largest accommodation of the people, very well protected. Passing over dead bodies will not work, you must act quietly.

Offer Babur to join the Free Hunters
If you drop Babur a note with a contract to work for the Free Hunters he will most likely swallow the money it offers and come to the camp himself.

Cause a scandal after which Babur will be banished from the Village
If you were to drop a note to the Village Elder that Babur is working for the Highwaymen, a scandal will ensue, and Babur will most likely be banished from the Village. Then he will come to the highwaymen.
