Uncle Council! It has begun! The Baron is preparing an uprising! He's finally made up his mind! :D

After all, I already know that. Am I a spy or not? I prepared a report for him.

Yes, we're coming for him. The Baron is eagerly awaiting him.

Well, don't be so quick to let anyone suspect me. After all, I'm often looked in on by firezers. That's why the report is tucked away in a storage room. You can take it from there.

In the cemetery.

Ah yes, that we didn't guess it either! A cemetery is exactly the kind of place that doesn't raise suspicion of being attended by a confectioner. Kiel is about to die laughing...

Don't laugh! You want a yeast cake? You obviously don't have a clue when it comes to confectionery. The cemetery grows a lot of spicy grasses that you won't find anywhere else. I often go there for them.

I hid the documents in a jug in the northern cemetery. Take them back to the Baron and come back, I still have some business to attend to. And I need you.
