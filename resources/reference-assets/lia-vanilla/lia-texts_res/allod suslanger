Suslanger
Suslanger belongs to the Khagadan Empire. Its territory is small, and the land suitable for cultivation is constantly decreasing. The river carving a deep canyon flows into a lake, which is the only source of drinking water. To survive in these inhospitable lands, the Suslanger people have built many dams and irrigation channels. Imperial authority is enforced in a brutal and ruthless manner. The guards mete out harsh punishments for even the most trivial offenses, while spies and informers report any deviation from the norm to the authorities.
