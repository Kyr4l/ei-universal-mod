Judgment Day
The Ataman of the Free Hunters has come up with a new idea. If all goes well, the people of the Village will leave the Foothills and will no longer venture further than the Free Hunters want them to.

Infiltrate the New Village
There are three gates in the New Village. You can get through any of them, but the western one is the most convenient.

Turn on the pyramid
The orcs who lived in the Foothills gave away the key to the Magic Pyramid. If you set the obelisk with this key, the Magic Pyramid will work again, and will start shooting lightning at people again!
#subobj 3
Get out of the range of the pyramid
The Magic Pyramid can fry anyone with lightning, as long as it's a human. Besides, there's no telling what effect it will show against humans, after all it's been out of action for so long...

Wait
While the Magic Pyramid is working it's better to stay away from it.
#subobj 5
Finish the job
It is possible that one of the humans survived and the pyramid has already unloaded. A combined force of Orcs and Free Hunters have gathered near the eastern gate and are planning an attack. You must help them!
