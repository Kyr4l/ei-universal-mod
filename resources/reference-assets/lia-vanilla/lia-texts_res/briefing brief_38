Kind Aliyo, I share your sadness. I am saddened that Fieruz died. I knew him very little.

No one knew him intimately. Only to me he was kind, so gracious, caring.... I loved him so...

And are you going to sprinkle your tears on the sand after him for a long time? You know it won't help him anymore. But if you take revenge for your loved one's death then know that Fieruz would approve.

Yes, but I don't know who to take revenge on, I don't know who killed him.

Buddy, you forgot you had Kiel with you! I saw who dealt the final blow to Fieruz. So gather your things, you will lead us to revenge for the best of us.

Kir, I respect you, of course, and more, but that's our right. We must take revenge whether you like it or not.
