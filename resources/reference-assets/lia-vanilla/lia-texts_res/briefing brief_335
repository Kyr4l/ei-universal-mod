Uncle Council, I just got back from that valley you told me about. You'll never guess what I found there!

After clearing the valley of the harpies that inhabited it, I noticed that there was a cave in the rock. But I was unable to get into it. The entrance is blocked by a stone gate with a strange design.

I could have sworn these doors were set up by the Joons. And the pattern on them is nothing more than a complex lock. But where's the key? We must get into this cave!

Interesting. I have to, but I don't know anything about this cave. I had a feeling it smelled like a secret! The key must now be found by you.

I've heard something recently about a particular trinket. Whether it be from a starost of some sort, or from a baron...

Uncle Council, please remember! This is very important to me.

Ah, exactly! Dartas was telling this story. He likes to walk around the neighborhood, that and he sees and notices a lot. Ask him.
