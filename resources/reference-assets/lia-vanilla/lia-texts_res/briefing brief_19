I'm glad to see you again, Helm. I'm told you've improved considerably in that time.

Dear Fazil! If only I knew how grateful I am to you! During that not-so-long time when we were making our escape and hiding from the chase, my entire not-so-long life flew before my eyes. I was saying good-bye to this world, mentally asking forgiveness of all the rich men I had robbed and all the pretty girls I had failed to kiss, and others and others.... and during that brief time a thought came into my head. From now on I will always follow you! Because if you get into trouble again, who will rescue you?
