Governor, we have caught the man who is guilty of the deaths of Birssen and Hys.

You set me up with some highwayman and you think I'll happily accept him as a murderer? I am a knowledgeable man and I know that to accuse a man you must first prove his guilt.

Now I'll tell it all: Birssen found out that someone was stealing from the common lodging money. The thief grasped that Brissen had seen through him, so he killed the knight. After all, the accommodation would not spare him if they found out who was stealing their money!

I understand, but what did my faithful mage Hys fall for!

And for the fact that the accommodation money turned out to be too little for him, and he decided to fly into the lab. Hys told the truth about the knife being stolen from him. But apart from that, the nugget that you had prepared as a gift to the capital was also stolen from him.

Ah, what a villain! I hope you found my nugget?

Yes, of course, here it is. Hys knew that losing the nugget would be a big blow to the master. Crooked, on the other hand, took advantage of the situation to free himself from his undesirables, and told Hys that they were going to conduct a caravan robbery to the capital.

For Hys, it was a chance to blame the robbers for losing the nugget. But that's not the main thing. The criminal was afraid that he would be caught too, so he decides to throw suspicion on Hys who we suspect anyway. So he drops off a knife stolen from Hys at the crime scene.

Now I understand why my people didn't find anything there the first time.

Yes, he did later. But then the Forest People saw him. Just like that, when he was hiding the stolen money. But let's go back to Hys. Wanting to justify himself, he made an appointment with me promising to bring a man with him who would confirm that he had nothing to do with Brissen's death. He brought to the meeting - Crooked.

But the highwayman judges people as himself. That's why he foresaw that Hys was preparing a trap for him, so he'd strike first.

All his ways proved futile. In the end, he was delivered by what it all started with - greed. We caught him at a place where he was hiding stolen goods. Baldie, is that it? Well?!

Mr. Governor, and the fact that I'm self-admitted to everything is going to help me?

How dare you... BARGAIN WITH ME! Your fate will be determined by the JUDGE!
