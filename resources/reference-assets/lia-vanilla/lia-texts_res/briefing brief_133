Ahaa, you were secretly going to kidnap me? That's not going to happen! Before you tell me where to find the flower, I won't take a step from here. Even if you eat me!

Wait, wait! There's no need to eat anyone. Dear Estero, your granddaughter is very worried about you and sent me after you.

And who are you for anyway? ... - I mean, when I'm not at home, my granddaughter's the one who gets all the gropes! But wait... there's something about you... Hey, dragon, look! Doesn't he remind you of anyone?

Yes, if you look not at the appearance but on the inside, he reminds me of that bold man to whom I gave the ancient sword.

It's a long story. Now your dispute must be brought to an end. From what I understand, you want to find a flower?

Not just any flower, but a particular flower! But what I need it for, you don't need to know. And this host of bone soldiers won't tell you where to find it!

If you promise to go right away, I'll tell you. Go to the lake area in the northwest where the swamps are. There you will find your flower.

To make it faster, I'll go get the flower myself.

Yes, go, my dear, make your grandmother happy, I'll wait for you here. I'll sweeten the dragon's loneliness, why should he sit here alone.
