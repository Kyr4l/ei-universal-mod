Kiel, so you were talking about running away? I want to get out of here as soon as possible.

Well, you've finally figured out that the only way out of here is to run! Hang on Kiel, I won't let you die!

Yeah, I figured you were pretty smart. So what's your plan?

Yesterday I managed to overhear a conversation between officers: it turns out that they have a map of the catacombs, with the help of which you can get to the other side of the hills. And from there it's a stone's throw to town! All in all, it's a breeze!

Oh, easy... all we have to do is steal this map from the officer and get to the catacombs by bypassing the guards. But first, we need to get out of this enclosure.

Out of the homestead? A... that's what I need you for.

Look! What kind of light is that? Have you ever seen one?

No, and I don't burn to observe such. Just in case, stay close, I feel something bad is about to happen.
