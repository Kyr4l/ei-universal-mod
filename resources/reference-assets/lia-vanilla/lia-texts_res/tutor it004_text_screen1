     The Quests screen gives detailed information about what quests are available in the current Game zone. It may provide hints, as well.

     The Quests screen is divided into several sections: on the left side is a list of quests and briefings. On the right side you'll see a simple map of the Game zone with various captions. See the next tutorial screen for more on the Zone Map.

     When you're in a Game zone, you can have several quests available at the same time. If you want more details on a particular quest and its objectives, just click on the quest name.

     To get back to the Game zone press the "V" button at the bottom of the screen, or the <TAB> key.
