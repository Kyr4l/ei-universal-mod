Admit it: horrible was it for you in accommodation to return? After the nugget you couldn't find?

Terrible or not - it doesn't matter! We got a case here, that and we're back.

We're looking for a magician, a friend of Brissen's. And the forest people said Brissen should be in this accommodation.

Then suppose the forest people have not deceived you. You find a magician. What do you want to do next?

What if he has his own issues? And he doesn't have time to deal with your problems yet? What then?

Kiel has this feeling that you want to give us advice. So go ahead, speak up, feel free.

You're thinking right, girl. I know from a good source that the mage is very interested in the ice elementals of the mine district. Also, if I were you, I'd help him with his research. Anyway, that's your business. You can wait for him here.

Yeah, yeah, thanks for the advice. But don't you dare call me a wench again!
