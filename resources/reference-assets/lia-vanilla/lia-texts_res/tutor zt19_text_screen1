     To complete quests successfully, use all opportunities provided in the game.

     During combat you can use "Pause" mode (press <SPACE> bar). In the pause mode you can assess your characters'  and enemies' health using data displayed in Information window, and order your characters to attack particular enemies, cast spells, change weapons or set them off in a particular direction. All your orders will be carried out as soon as the pause mode is switched off (press <SPACE> bar again).

     You can order one of your characters to follow another game character. To do that, click on "Follow" icon (the cursor will change shape), then place it over the character to be followed and click again. Your currently selected character will follow him until you issue another command.

     You can switch on "Camera tracking" mode. To do that, double-click on the character's icon in the lower part of the screen. The camera will start tracking this character until you use any other camera control command.
