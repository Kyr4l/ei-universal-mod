Ragout with mushrooms
The storming of the Khadagan fortress would go much easier if you fed the enemy soldiers with a special meal, so that instead of fighting they would have something else on their mind and in another part of their body. To prepare the debilitating ragout Uncle Council needs a large pumpkin and venomous mushrooms.

Find a pumpkin
A suitable pumpkin can be found in one of the shelves not far from the Khadagan fortress.

Take the pumpkin
The right pumpkin for the ragout is the only ripe one from this field. It's impossible to mistake it for another.

Find the mushrooms
The venom in the mushrooms should not have worked immediately, otherwise too few guards will be poisoned. Suitable mushrooms only grow by the river, more south of Uncle Zaciesz's tent.

Go mushroom picking
Mushrooms are only venomous when eaten, collecting them should not be dangerous.
