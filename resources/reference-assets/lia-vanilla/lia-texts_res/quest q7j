Duel
Arrogant Dartas should be punished and a duel is the only way to teach him a lesson.

Come to the place of the duel
Duels are forbidden in times of war, so the meeting place is in a remote area, far from the city. Dartas has chosen the Isle of Death, near the harbor. Have your weapons at the ready.

Spank Dartas!
You can't kill the Baron's son, but a good beating will obviously do him good. But not in the face, the wounds from this illegal duel shouldn't be noticed.
