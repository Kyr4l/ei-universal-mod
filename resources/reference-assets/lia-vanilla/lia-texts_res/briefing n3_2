Kir? Is that you? What kind of pig you got on your head! Fu!

It's so you don't attract attention on the streets. Fieruz told me that it's appropriate for many sick people after the plague to cover their faces like this. He also helped me get a proper scarf.

The right one! And tearing off a piece of the leg and doing the same thing was a no brainer? You wanted to pass yourself off as a sage by wrapping your head in fabric that is worth at least ten coins per elbow! HA, ha, ha!!! I haven't laughed so much in a long time! What a sly one this Fieruz is....

I'm glad I made you laugh... and just in case, Rindeil promised to help me get back to Jygran, and free my family!

Rindeil promised something? Don't be particularly hopeful. I think he has already forgotten about it. He's only interested in his spiders and ladybugs.... He's a harmless old man, but there's no help to be expected from him.

Also something... I usually only rely on myself anyway. Karim told me that there were rumors about Joon on Suslanger. He in turn promised to find out more about it. If I find this Joon, I will find my people!

Hm... Joon? I've never heard of such a thing. But Karim interacts with all kinds of people, so maybe it's true. Anyway, I've decided to keep an eye on you to make sure you don't get tricked by some Fieruz again. From now on, your friend Kiel will be inseparable from you!
