Who are you guys! Be kind enough to explain your appearance, or I will call the guard. The portal you just came out of never worked. I look forward to your explanations, what does it all mean?

Damn! Did I make a mistake? This place is totally not like the Jygran I remember.

Sir, we are surprised no less than you. We intended to get to a completely different place.

This abandoned portal was shown to us by a mage, and we decided to test his guess. He guessed that the portal would take us to Jygran. But apparently we got into one of the provinces of Cania.

You're both right, you and your mage. This fortress is the last refuge of the Canian empire on Jygran. For many generations my family has maintained-.

If you wish to fight, I will gladly accept you into the soldiers of the garrison. Your weapons will serve a good cause. If not, step aside and do not interfere, or else I will recommend that you be thrown into prison. We will continue our conversation after the attack. Heh, if we survive it.
