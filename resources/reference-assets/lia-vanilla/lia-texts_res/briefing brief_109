I'm so glad we got here just in time. It's strange that the harpy attacked you. Judging by everything it wasn't her territory.

The young orc dumbfounded. He wanted to kill a harpy-harp. Alone! She's strong, the first-first to go. You're a brash warrior, the chief you saved. Great warrior! Urk-Tar is grateful to you.
