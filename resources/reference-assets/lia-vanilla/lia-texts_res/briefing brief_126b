Oh, so you're Bor, the ataman of the Free Hunters. Well, hello. What, will you take in a blacksmith in your camp? Well, because some wretch dropped a note to the elder that I'm going to join the orcs and the robbers... - Well, it's to the Free Hunters.

And suddenly everyone in the Village rushed at me! Well, there was nothing left for me but, in truth, to move to you.

Blacksmith, we are all very happy that you have made this decision. What an auspicious coincidence! There are many opportunities to make money here! You will be able to sell your wares even to orcs! The money will flow to you!

Orcs? I will never trade with them in my life! Although... if they, I mean, pay with real coins, I'll still think about whether to trade with them or not.

Well will you sell me something from armor or weapons? I have something to pay for!

Er, what about you for one? I haven't seen you once on Gipath! And yet people come here once or twice and know each other inside out. And you're kind of weird. Another Chosen One, I suppose?

#phrase Hero 7
I'm not the Chosen One, although I do have a certain affection for him. I was told that you and he were friends, and I very much hope you can tell me something about him.

But first I'd really like to order some good stuff from you, because the hunters are about to start laughing at me.

#phrase Smith 9
Well... to make a suit of armor so that no one would laugh at it, I need a Magic Needle. I heard, I mean, there's a grave of some blacksmith in the Tomb of the Lizards, and there in it, I mean, there should be such a needle once.

And... if you bring me this needle, I'll use it to sew you a suit of armor. Only you, this one, don't forget to pay me for the work!
