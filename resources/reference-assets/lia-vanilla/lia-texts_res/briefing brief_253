This is simply a disaster! Clever man, there was no magic ore in this ravine! It's all gone! We'll never be able to produce the key!

Don't be mad, but I sent you away on purpose, knowing in advance there was nothing there. It's just that if you'd stayed here, you'd have been in my way. At least you were busy doing something useful.

Don't be angry young man. Something else is more important now. We have a gate, opening the way to an unknown passage, and we have a key opening that gate. We must decide what to do next.

After all, there's nothing to decide here! I have to go through this portal immediately!

It's not that simple. A closer examination of the situation forces me to conclude that the Portal is malfunctioning. I can't feel the ground on the other side of it at all. It's as if there is a void there.

Or something more dangerous - an absorbing spell so powerful that all my attempts at mental passage simply go out in it, like fire in water.

Tka-Rick also said that he absolutely does not detect Jygran. There is no doubt. This Portal will lead me to Jygran!

But if your destination is on the other side of it, then I can't help but wish you good luck.
