It all adds up! The person who stole the cash also killed Brissen! After all, then Gray Leaf didn't say that another man was hiding something - he meant the same man they saw at the murder scene.

I'll take it from here. I'm about to spread the word to everyone that we stumbled upon a stash of money in the woods. We'll set an official refund for tomorrow. And tonight the thief will run to his stash to move everything.

And all that's left for us to do is track him there. That's easy! Kiel, bravo!
