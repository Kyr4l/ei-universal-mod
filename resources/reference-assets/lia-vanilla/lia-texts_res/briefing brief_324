Have you learned enough lessons? Thank me that I felt sorry for your father and didn't want to kill you.

I don't need your schleppiness! It would be better if you killed me. Anything's better than seeing your own family and all your hopes for the future die.

How to fight? In recent times, we have lost the Dar-Ugorn! Our people are dying from disease and at the hands of enemies. When the father dies - the last hope will die too.

You're young, it's all in your hands. Take up your weapon and fight. Today you proved that you can fight. So channel your skills for the cause of Jygran's rebirth!

Firez! He's a bloody executioner and tyrant, keeping my family in slavery! I was a slave all my youth, but I managed to escape even though everyone thought it was a crazy idea and never even tried. But I escaped, found friends and help. And now I'm back for revenge.

You really are crazy. But I like that. Your insanity will lead us to victory. I believe you.
