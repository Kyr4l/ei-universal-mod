Tyn-Achei didn't call you. What did he come for?

I just came to get acquainted. My name is Kir, and the girl with me is Kiel. We had already gotten acquainted with the chief, so we decided to talk to the shaman too.

Clairvoyant- clairvoyant protects the spirit of the tribe, protects the strength. Clairvoyant strong-strong-the tribe lives. Strangers come and destroy everything-destroy everything. Tyn-Achei does not like aliens-aliens.

The chief received us very well. It seemed to me that he was speaking for the whole tribe.

Urk-Tar is a strong chief, wise-wise. The clairvoyant should not have argued-argued with the chief. You will come, then you will go. The clairvoyant and the chief always-will be.

You guessed correctly. I won't stay here for long. But you don't have to spoil your contact with the chief because of me. Don't be afraid, I won't do your tribe any harm, on the contrary, if help is needed, I'll be happy to help.

And I'll- I'll watch that you're not only clairvoyant, but you're tinkering with magic!

The clairvoyant and the chief always-will do everything themselves for the tribe-tribe. An axe then-when strong, if the chief made it, and the clairvoyant gave it strength.
