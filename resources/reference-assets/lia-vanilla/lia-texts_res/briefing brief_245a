Kir, please listen to me. I am aware that I find it hard to believe, but this knife really was stolen! Some arrogant thief infiltrated my laboratory and robbed me! He stole my knife, many valuable items, and even what was given to me for safekeeping by the governor!

What I do know is that the caravan that was supposed to carry the nugget was empty! But I don't see why I should believe you.

It fell to me to outfit the caravan. I couldn't admit that a nugget had been stolen from me. Then, a man contacted me, and communicated that there was a robbery planned for the caravan. That suited me so well!

I decided to set up an ambush to catch the robbers and then blame the missing nugget on them. But nothing came of it!

I need evidence. For now, the knife found at the crime scene convinces me more.

I will arrange a meeting with this man! I have evidence! Come to the edge of the woods outside of town. I'll bring the evidence.
