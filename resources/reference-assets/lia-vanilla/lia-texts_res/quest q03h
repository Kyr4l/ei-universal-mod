Catacombs
Going through the old catacombs is the only way to get out of the fortress. These corridors have not been used for a long time, and dangerous creatures may have nested here!

Use the elevator
The elevator was previously used for smuggling heavy goods from the fortress to the outside and back. It is most likely still in operation.

Search the trunk 
It is possible that some of the stolen goods were forgotten or not carried away in time. Even the old stuff left here may be useful now.
#subobj 3
Leave the catacombs!
The guards must have figured out by now that someone stole the map of this passage to use it. Better not stop here...
