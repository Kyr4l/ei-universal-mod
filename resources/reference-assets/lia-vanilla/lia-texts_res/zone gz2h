The town of Suslanger and its surroundings
The town, which gave its name to all the land around it, is situated on the shore of a lake from which irrigation canals extend. The people working in the fields are unarmed, but ready to raise the alarm at the sight of strangers, or else they themselves will be threatened with punishment.
