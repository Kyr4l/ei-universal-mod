My young friend, I am so old that in the life I have left I cannot repay you for freeing us! You have done a deed worthy of the heroes of old.

#phrase Hero 2
Dear Tui-Lena, it was not my desire for fame that drove me. From the moment I decided to flee I wanted only one thing: to regain the freedom of the Joons, deceived by Firez.

It saddens me to say this, but how foolish and naive we were to believe the words of a blinded proponent of necromancy! Fear of the Curse of our lineage has clouded our sanity...

#phrase Junofil 4
We have failed to correct the error. The bright minds of the Joon race have been lost for eternity. My friend, this is hard for me to say, but your parents are dead. They will always be with us, in our memory.

I'm late! Firez! I will have my revenge on him! Only his death will bring me relief!

Scary to say what his death will bring with it. A spell will fall and we will become exposed to the Curse. We will be condemned and your efforts to save us will become meaningless...

No, the curse has been destroyed! Tka-Rick and young Joon At-Zako have killed it. Nothing more threatens us from her!

I'll die happy knowing that.

He doesn't say yes, you'll live through a lot more. Your wisdom and knowledge is what we need.

You're already wise enough to do without my advice.

No, just now the advice won't hurt me. On Jygran, I found a cave that is locked with a Joon castle. I found an amulet that should unseal it, but apparently that's not enough. I did not manage to enter the cave.

He, he. It's nice to know I can still be of service. My young friend, you're incredibly lucky. In this cave you will find many useful things. The way to it is now open. But don't ask me how I did it.
