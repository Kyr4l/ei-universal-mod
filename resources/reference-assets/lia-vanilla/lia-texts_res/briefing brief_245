Governor, I've been investigating the crime scene and I found something. This will help us find out who the real murderer is. Take a look, do you recognize the knife too?

What an impertinence! Do you think I know every knife in my province? Although... Yeah, I recognize that exquisite blade. And the handle... HYS! And how do you understand that? How did my gift end up at the scene of the murder?

The arguments of this self-proclaimed investigative judge accept no criticism! Yes, this knife belongs to me. It was given to me by his highness Governor Valrasian. But it was stolen from me!

Then why are you only now bringing this up? Does losing such a precious thing mean so little to you?

#phrase Hero 5
Or did you keep quiet about it because you lost the knife after killing Brissen during your hasty escape? After all, it was to your advantage both the death of the knight and the removal of the old mage.

One tried to interfere with your experiments on nature, and the other you were simply afraid of. But with one strike you remove both. How convenient!

What a brazen lie! Mr. Governor, I have no intention of listening to any more crazy accusations unsupported by any evidence. Even Karansul had more motives and opportunities to do so. He is the real criminal!

You have been told that the knife was stolen. My magician is not a murderer. Your zeal is laudable, but let it know its limits!
