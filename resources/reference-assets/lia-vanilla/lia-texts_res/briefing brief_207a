Take it easy. You're probably waiting for us to bring you some balm from the forest people?

Son, you brought it! Well, Gray Leaf after all told you what a useful remedy this is, and I'm not young anymore: joints broken, back aches. And if you rub this on them, everything goes away at once!

All right, kids, but you went to the forest people anyway. So what interesting stories did they tell you?

According to Grey Leaf, Brissen is now in some accommodation in the west of the mine. Do you know where that is?

Ah, the old head! I wish I had thought of that myself! Exactly, he said something about his friend being interested in old mines.

And this accommodation was set up by peasants and workers who no longer wanted to live under the governor. The authorities now think of them as highwaymen, but really they just want to live on their own, that kind of thing.
