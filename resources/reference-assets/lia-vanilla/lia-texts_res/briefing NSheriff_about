And because we happen to have a fairly closed society, not...

Society?

Specifically, society.

A scientist said this, when I was still making him these thin scissors, and something he called scalpels, that and I remembered.

No. I am not a blacksmith but a craftsman. They call me Arhar.

And what kind of artisan are you and why do you work here?

#phrase NSheriff 10
I'm a craftsman making all kinds of clever little things that scientific people need for experiments or whatever. And I make guns, I have to live for something. And why here? Because there's nowhere else, it's not convenient for the masters of magic that there's anyone but them, the masters.
