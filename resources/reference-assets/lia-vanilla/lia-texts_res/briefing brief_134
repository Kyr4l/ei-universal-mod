Estero, I found a flower. I didn't expect it to be so dangerous in the swamp, and the flower resisted a bit.

Well, what did you want, that everything should go in your hand by itself?! All right, hand me the flower - a little more carefully, look.... - Leaves like you messed up, eh! But anyway, thank you, now we can go home! There you'll tell me what you wanted from me.

Who knows, he flew off somewhere, completely aged apparently. He even forgot to take his skeletons away from the mountain! Hey boy, I don't even know your name!

Aaah, she's a nice and fierce girl. You won't go wrong with her! I was like that myself in my youth. And now I can still be like that for a while, and I'll cut my own way out of the Dead City!
