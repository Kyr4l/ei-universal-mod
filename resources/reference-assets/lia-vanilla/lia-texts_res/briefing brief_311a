Oh my savior! I am not angry with you, even though you have uninvitedly interfered in my life. We are all in the hands of death, and only it will judge us.

Don't scare me with your tales of death. I do not come to ask you for forgiveness. You've done a lot of damage, your undead have overrun the entire neighborhood.

As I said, I'm a theorist. This was my first practical experience. I know a hundred and one ways to calm the undead, but I've never applied them. If you'll just give me a month to practice...

While studying in the library of the old tower, I found a scroll. It said that a hero was buried on the Isle of Death. He was credited with defeating the great necromancer who built this tower.

Excuse me, ladies. Well, this hero had a remedy to fight the undead - Magic Herbs. When he died, the remains of this remedy were buried with the hero.

Reason. There is hope that the tincture still lies in the tomb. Eh, it's not the first time I've disturbed the peace of the dead to then restore peace to the living.
