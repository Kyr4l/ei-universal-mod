Go to the city road
Much of the way to the transfer site passes along the road leading to the Dead City.

The material transfer site is a neglected cottage in the southwest of the area.

Leave a report and samples
You don't know when the messenger from Suslanger will arrive, so it's better to leave everything you need in a chest in the ruined house.
