Death Island
The island was once used by Cania as a naval hub - in the form of an old harbor and dilapidated warehouses that have survived to this day. Now a powerful necromancer has settled here, whose strength has caused half the island to die. On Dragon Mountain stands a symbol of human freedom, the statue of the heroic vampire destroyer.
