     Transfer areas are special places and are marked in clouds of yellow particles in the Game zone (and yellow blocks on the mini-map). Use them to move from one Game zone to another. Since changing Game zones is an important step, you'll be asked to confirm when your character enters a Transfer area.

     Your character is near the village right now. You've completed the quest and found the way to a human settlement. The only thing left for him to do is enter it - i.e. use a Transfer area.

     If you are controlling several characters at the same time, your must get them all into the Transfer area to be able to use it. You cannot leave some of the characters in the Game zone and move others out of it.
