Here come the mushrooms! Just in time. Now the mushrooms are fried, and with onions, and mushrooms. Mmm... yummy.

And you what! Did you forget what Uncle Council said? This is poisoned ragout. You want to sit in the bushes for the entire assault?

I just don't understand why we're dragging a pumpkin in here? I think for the ragout it will be rather unnecessary. It will give unnecessary sweetness and kill the flavor of the mushrooms.

It will. But what's most important to us? That everything works in time! Many operations have fallen through poor preparation of possible options.

And suddenly it would happen that their soldiers would eat the ragout beforehand - and its effect would end by the beginning of the assault! And then - consider everything lost. And the pumpkin will slow down and prolong the effect of the mushroom venom.

And that's what'll keep them running around the johns for half the day. You want a cookie? No? Tough.

Excellent! But it seems to Kiel that we're going to run too. To spread your stock over the soldiers' food supplies. And on our successful actions depends the success of the entire assault.
