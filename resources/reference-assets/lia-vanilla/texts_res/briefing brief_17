Rindeil! Rindeil! Well, it's me, Kir! But if even you didn't recognize me, it means the cloak is working. It's hot in here, but like you said, every remedy has side effects.

My boy! You've scared the hell out of me. But now you'll be free to go into areas with Japingus. As you know they jump from trees onto the heads of their victims and dig their fangs into the uncovered skin. And just as I look at it now, would you like to go to them now? I've been wanting to show you my collection for a long time.
