Brother Khatul, glad to see you again! I hope the Brotherhood has already recovered from the battle.

Yes Brother Kir, the situation has improved and there is a renewed sense of confidence and duty in the people.

From what I remember, you lost your mage in that battle. Who will replace him now?

So far we are lamenting the loss of brother Keb. We will miss him very much, especially since there is no one to replace him now.

Yes, yes, I remember. And do you know a necromancer named Kehel? I think your help is needed now. Find him and offer him shelter, he will probably be very grateful to you.

Yes, I know who Kehel is. We will be advised if he joins our Brotherhood. Thank you for that advice, Brother Kir.
