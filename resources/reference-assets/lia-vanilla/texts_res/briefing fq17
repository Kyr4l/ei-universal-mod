Well, that's how it goes. Otherwise, we wouldn't understand each other.

It happens, but not always. You can hear but not understand. You can freeze next to fire, die of thirst next to water and starve next to food.

#phrase Haburu 6
Let me explain. There is a tree in the mountains where many people put on iron armor. It grows next to water, but it does not get a drop. People have tamed the water and located it in a well. But people do not think about the living tree which also needs water, like they need food.
