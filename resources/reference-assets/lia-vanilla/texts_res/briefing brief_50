You're too young and rash in your judgments. You are like a running antelope which, escaping from a hunter, runs straight into the lair of a tiger. Soon it will be known that the entire research team has disappeared, and the search will begin. Then sooner or later they will find our hideout.

No, I have another idea. If they find, let's say, a few robalogle bodies at the battle site, then everyone will come to the conclusion that the squad died in the fight against the rulers of the underworld. And the investigation will be over!

No more, I'm not going to let an adventure like this pass me by. Let's go, there's no time to waste.
