Find Sahilla
Aliya's friend who managed to escape from prison is located in the north of the desert. At least probably, because she hasn't been found in the south.

Search the northern part of the desert
There is a small and fairly safe ravine in the north. It is possible that Sahilla decided to wait there for some time.

Search the north-eastern part of the desert
There are several ogres living in the northeastern part of the desert, and the guards prefer to avoid this area. Therefore, it is possible that Sahilla is hiding somewhere there.

Escort Sahilla to the Last Sanctuary
Sahilla is very weak and will not be able to travel alone. You need to guide her through the area.
