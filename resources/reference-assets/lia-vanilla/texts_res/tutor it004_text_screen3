     Your character will receive most of his quests while talking to other characters in the Dialog zones.  Occasionally, however, new quests may appear while he's in the Game zone.

     Some quests must be done in order for the game to advance, while others are optional. You character will gain a certain amount of experience in each quest. If he was not alone, the experience will be credited to the whole team. Some quests will also bring monetary rewards. You'll see the "value" of each quest at the end of its description.

     Most quests are divided into several objectives. Each represents a "stage" of completion. Some objectives will be available immediately at the start when you receive the quest. You can consider these the first stages. Other objectives will then appear after you've complete the previous stages.
     Completed objectives are marked with a "V" on the objectives list. Objectives which for some reason can no longer be completed will be marked with an "X". Completed quests will be shown on the list with the word "completed".

     Note: a quest might be marked as completed although you have yet to complete all objectives. It's not always required that you complete all objectives within a quest.
