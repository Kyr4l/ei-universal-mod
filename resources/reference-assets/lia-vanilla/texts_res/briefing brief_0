Boy! Where do you think you're going, trying to get bitten by armadillos? You know what, sitting in this dry-throated hollow is boring, I don't even have a drop of wine left!

Boy, don't fret. You're incredibly lucky. There's no use sitting here waiting for a job. I know someone who hires young men temporarily, we can send you there.

You're doing me a favor too... As if you had a choice. Keep your papers and walk down the road, thanks to them the guards will let you through. Once you get to the camp, show the papers, people will help you through the Portal. Before you go to Suslanger. Although... the climate there is such that you can't help it, and there are a lot of soldiers.

This is not the kind of thing I've been through before. But thanks for the warning, I'll be careful.

We're talking... Okay, tell the camp to send me a couple of barrels of wine. I'm not gonna drink water!
