Permission in the mine
During his last visit to a mine, an old mage lost a document confirming that he was there. This paper could serve as the magician's excuse.

Take the key
There are plenty of doors in the cave that can only be opened with a special key, which can be found in the security room in the northwest of the mine. Along the way, it's best not to bump into the mine guards - they'll attack anyone who doesn't have permission.

Come to the eastern part
Most likely, the mage lost the document while traveling in the eastern part of the mine, which has long been abandoned.

Enter the forbidden part
Apparently the mage's permit got lost in the most dangerous part of the cave.

Find the paper
A temporary permit to enter the mine fell out of the mage's pocket near a large puddle in the eastern part of the mine.
