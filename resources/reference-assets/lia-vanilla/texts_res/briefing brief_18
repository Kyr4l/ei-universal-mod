Oh my boy, that's the way I am, you don't have to. We men of science should help each other. But since you're here, perhaps you won't refuse me a favor?

And I didn't doubt it, my boy. The point is, I have been contacted by one very influential man in our circles, and he has offered a deal: he is giving me a magnificent specimen for my collection, and in return he asks for a sample of the meteroite that was recently delivered from the Useless Lands. I simply cannot pass up such an opportunity!

Okay, I'd be honored to bring something like this. Just where to look for it?

Don't worry, I've already thought of everything. I learned that the protection of the meteorite is assigned to the commander of the city guard. To start, get through to their headquarters and overhear what they're talking about there.

Exactly! That's where I can find out where they store the samples they brought in!

Go then, my boy, I will wait for you impatiently.
