Yeah, I'm glad to see you guys too. I'm looking for another man, craftsman Babur from the hunter's camp. They say he was kidnapped by orcs. Do you not know why they did this and where they took the craftsman?

Urk-Tar knows-it-all. The craftsman is a bad man-the man was. He gave his word to the orcs, then he cheated. The orcs of the artisan-craftsman stole. They punished him.

And what did they do with Babur? I hope they didn't kill him?

The orcs of the artisan-craftsman didn't kill him. They gifted him. The ogre on the island-island lives. He will eat the craftsman - he will be good. The orcs will listen.
