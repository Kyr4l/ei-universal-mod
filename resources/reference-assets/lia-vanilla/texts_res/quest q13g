An unfortunate hunt
According to the chief, the people of the New Village put so much pressure on the camp of the highwaymen that they practically ruined their hunting opportunity. At the same time, the villagers themselves are hunting in the area, and it has always belonged to the robbers. The chief asked that the people be dissuaded from the hunting grounds of the Free Hunters.
