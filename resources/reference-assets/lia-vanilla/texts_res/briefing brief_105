Chief, we have been living in your camp for some time now. We don't want to be a burden to you. Maybe we could help with something, do something useful?

Kir, speak for yourself. I feel good here and I'm not tired of any remorse.

Man-to-man wants to help the orc! But strangely! You good-guy. For now you are our guest-guest. If you want to become like us - a true warrior-warrior, you should-get a battle axe.

Okay. And where do I get this axe?

The axe-the axe the clairvoyant makes. And you stone-stone you bring. When the stone is good the axe is good too, and the warrior is mighty. The best stone is in the Dead city-town.

Perfect. In that case, we'll go to the Dead City for the best stone.

And didn't you forget that we also have to return the stone patterns with the report? You're not going to send the best ones to Suslanger, are you? I would suggest the other way around, which is to look for the worst and somewhere else, such as here in Distant Peaks.
