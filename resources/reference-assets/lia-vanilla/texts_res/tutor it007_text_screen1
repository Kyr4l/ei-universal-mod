     This screen gives certain information about your characters, including their skills and abilities. Each character gains a certain amount of experience in the course of completing quests. Here you can 'spend' that experience to acquire new abilities and develop existing skills. You can also issue spells to characters here, which they can cast during the game.

     You can select which character you're working on by using the buttons on either side of his/her name.
There are four panels in the middle of the screen. These are, from left to right:
     Attributes panel
     Skills and known abilities panel
     Available abilities panel
     Descriptions panel
     See the next tutorial screens for more information on these panels.

     At the bottom of the Attributes panel there's the "Your Experience" section (framed). Use the "V" and "X" buttons to confirm/cancel any changes in skills and abilities you've made using the other panels.

     Note: the changes you make in other panels do not become active until you confirm them in the "Your Experience" section. If you proceed without confirming, the changes will be cancelled as soon as you switch to another screen.
