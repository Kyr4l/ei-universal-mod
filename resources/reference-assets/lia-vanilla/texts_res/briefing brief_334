Lord Baron, Uncle Rada obeyed your order and once again amazed us with his being knowledgeable. With his help we were able to apply for a map. A more detailed map is nowhere to be found and at Firez himself!

Great! Yes, now we just have a way forward! The Khadagan lands lie before me as if in plain sight. Reading this map, I can already see that the song of our enemies has already been sung. Inform the soldiers! WE ARE GOING TO STORM!!!

Finally. By taking this crossover, I will get one more step closer to my goal. But oh how I hate the anticipation! But I will fight the khadagans all the more fervently!
