     You are now in the Game zone without a quest (press the <TAB> key to call up quests screen and you'll see it's empty).

     To get a quest, return to the village and talk to the people there.
     
     Note: Not every conversation will lead to your receiving new quests. However if you don't have a quest to perform anywhere in the Game zones, that definitely means that somebody in the village wants to talk to you, and this talk will result in a new quest.
