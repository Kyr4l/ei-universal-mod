Yes, I know. The shell is there. The lake lizards no longer bother me. Good. Now I will fulfill my part of the bargain.

When I met with this man, he was interested in an old mage who lives on Gipath. I told him about the way to him. He went there.

Oh, so that's it: Joon went to the old magician. Surely it won't hurt me to meet him too. Anyway, you have to try to do it. Tell me how to reach this magician too.

An old man lives in the Distant Peaks. Find the ravine that starts in the east of the mountains and goes through them. He will lead you to a lake. The mage's cave is on the north shore of the lake. And here I have fulfilled my part of the bargain.
