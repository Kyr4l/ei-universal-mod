Dartas, I've been told you like long walks.

Yeah. What's so weird about that? You need something to do eventually. It's so boring here...

It's a good habit. I also like to travel, to discover different mysteries. Walking in a valley between two rivers recently, I found a cave.

I wasn't able to get into it, the entrance is closed with a slab. There's a Joon sign on the slab, and a small rectangular hollow in the middle, as if an element was missing there. And yet - this cave was protected by harpies.

Harpies? That's very strange. That village was raided by harpies too.

What village?

There was a village west of Dar-Leanos. A pretty village, and the starotsa's daughter was a real beauty. And the starosta found a nice... medallion, I think. He showed it to me.

The next night, this village was raided by harpies. And the village was not saved. The harpies settled there for good.

And where is the medallion now? Describe it.

Well it was a rectangular one, with a nice blue stone. I asked him to sell it to me, but the governor didn't want it. He said it was his family heirloom.

And now his whole family's dead and the memento's lying there in their destroyed house.

I'm not sure, but I think it's worth trying to find that amulet. And try using it to remove the seal from the cave entrance.
