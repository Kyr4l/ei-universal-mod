Well, a soldier told me about it. There's been quite a ruckus over this Joon, there's been a terrible robbery on the property he was in. I don't know who attacked him, but they told me that no one was left alive, and the dead were taken away in wheelbarrows. And Joon disappeared like a stone into water.

Kir, don't listen to this, it's just some fairy tale. What these drunken soldiers don't talk about....

That's right, they don't! This is the truth! And I will find a way to prove it to you! I'll try to get an ad that talks about a robbery on the property.
