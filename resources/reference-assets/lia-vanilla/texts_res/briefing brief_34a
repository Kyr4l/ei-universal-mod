Your fears have been confirmed. The caravan had indeed succumbed to a robbery. But don't worry, I managed to take all the illegal goods before the guards arrived.

Oh, how heavy it all is, how heavy! The goods are gone, the caravan is gone. Well, what am I supposed to do now? And what happened to the caravan? I'll know what to be afraid of.

The strangest thing was that at first glance, I thought the caravan had been attacked by wild animals. But having examined the scene more closely, I found a short note. It said: 'I am at Azbek's', and the signature: 'Tarik'.

Give me a look! Tarik... my old caravan chaser. But, Azbek! And this is all his doing? I always knew he was a dishonest merchant, but how could he fall so low?

Aunty Zaro, you need to rescue your herder quickly and finally deal with this Azbek. Otherwise he won't give you a break.

And you're right again. Azbek has a well-protected house in the city, and that's definitely where my Tariq is kept. Bring him to me alive, please, he's my best chaser!
