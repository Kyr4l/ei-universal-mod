Dear Kira, I still left unfinished business in the mines. But the governor allowed me to enter there only with permission, and accompanied by a soldier.

My present permit has already expired, and I would have to write a new one to the governor. But I don't want to appear in town, lest I cause too much displeasure to the governor and his court magician.

Therefore, Kira, I want to ask you to go to the governor and convince him to issue a new permit. And in the meantime, I'm going to learn Ingos magic space so I can determine the whereabouts of your artifact.

Admittedly, I'm afraid that the increased activity of the robalogs will cause some delays and affect the accuracy of the data. That's why I want to complete the mine survey sooner so that their magical manifestations can be disregarded.

Dear Jam-Akaro! It is my great honor to do you a favor. You won't even blink an eye, and I'll be back with your permission!
