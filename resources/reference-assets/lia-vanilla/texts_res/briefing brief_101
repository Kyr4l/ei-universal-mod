My warriors have seen that you from the Dead-Dead city have come. There the living-living did not. Where did you come from?

We have come from another land. Here is an expedition of the Khadagan Empire that we should find and hand over a packet with orders.

Kir, your words made too much of an impression on him. Because he obviously understood everything about it.

We search the camp for aliens who wear iron armor and are looking for something here. Do you know where they are?

Orcs don't like aliens. We killed them, we smashed the camp. Ah, it was fun and merry! No more aliens on Gipath.

Ah, yes! And what, there's nothing left of them? Did anyone even survive?

No. My warriors-warriors in the camp destroyed everything. One chest-cuff remains, iron, strong, the key at the ogre's lies. He helped us. Good ogre.

Kiel would advise you to remember this. There might be something useful in that trunk. You'd just have to steal the key from the ogre.

And look, you're a brave, bold and savvy warrior. Surely you can help us in our quest.

I am the chief of my-my tribe. I Urk-Tar. I the most powerful chief on Gipath. Only Shei-var more-more me, but he is far-away, in the Sands.

Ah, now I will-be like Shei-var. The Chosen One helped him. Now with me the Chosen One will be. He will help the tribe. It will be good.

What seems to be the story with this Chosen One? But if the chief will let me tame Gipath here, one might agree to help his tribe.

My name is Kir, and my child's name is Kiel. We agree to help your tribe, and we hope you will help us too.
