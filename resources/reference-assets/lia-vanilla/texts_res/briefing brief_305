Ah, here you are again, here to nag. After all, I told you: I've got a lot to do, I don't have time to deal with silly things.

That's interesting! First he complained that they only came to him with business and now he's unhappy that they're pulling him away from them!

Well because I don't like it.

But that you don't like what? That they're pulling you away or just coming in on business?

We've freed the village from the wandering dead. Now the neighborhood will become more peaceful.

But each time it flies again from under the ground. Just like rust, no way you can get away from it!

It's a strange thing. Surely there's an explanation for it. Magic or something. How would you explain it?

Take a walk to the candy merchant. He will be able to help you.

To the candy vendor? What's he gonna help you with?

He secretly serves our baron. He gives us all the news from the khadagan side. And in general he knows a lot about everything. Just don't tell anyone!

Follow the road to Dar-Ulgorn and then south. There his tent stands. But in order for him to receive you, you must tell him a special phrase. Lean closer, I'll say it in a whisper....
