So are you the strangers who came through the old portal?
#ANIMATION 15

#phrase Hero 2
Yeah, those are the ones. We even managed to take part in the defense of the fortress.

Oh, the zombie attack. And by the way, I've seen it. I don't like it.

What exactly is it that you don't like? That we defended your fortress or that zombies were attacking?

That the zombies were attacking, of course! Defenders are not expendable, and I could use some helpers. How many times have I asked the Baron to assign men to me...

Apparently, you're a very good craftsman. I've noticed that weapons and armor are fine in warriors.

And you still doubt that? I am the craftsman Stark! I know all the secrets and wisdom of the craft of blacksmithing, spell recipes, and the making of complex herbs! I am a very good craftsman. Ancestral!

Well, that's some good luck for us. And will you be able to make something for us as well?

More what! Don't you think I have anything else to do? I got a whole garrison of soldiers here! And everyone needs to patch things up, sharpen things up, heal things up...

Well, if we need anything, it's the little things.

Little things? Little things you can. But no more! And just plain come talk. Because only come to me when you need something. And not just to stop by, ask how things are going, tell me the news...
