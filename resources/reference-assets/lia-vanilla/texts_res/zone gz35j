Sadrok City and Surrounding Area
The city of Sadrok and the lands around it are the mainstay of the Kadagan Empire on Jygran. Numerous armies of the living and the dead have gathered in the city, and there is Castle of Firez, a working harbor, a military academy, a necromancer's guild, and the homes of aristocrats. High in the mountains to the south is the Joon Prison.
