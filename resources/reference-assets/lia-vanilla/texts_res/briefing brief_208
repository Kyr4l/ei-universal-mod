I'm glad to see you, man. But you come at a sad time.

What happened?

Far to the north where a river flows, animals are dying. They go to drink the water, but find only death in it. My best healers went there to save the animals, but death proved to be stronger.

Turns out there's some kind of poison in the water. That means you don't have to treat the animals but clean the water!

As sometimes in the sound of the wind one can hear a beautiful song, so in your words this time one can hear a wise truth. To the healers of my people, the healing of water has proven too difficult.

And did you find out where the poison gets into the water?

A wolf killing a sick hare frees it from torment, but at the same time brings death to it. The machines of men serve them well, but at the same time they bring no small amount of damage. By the river, there is... a manufactory. It is because of it that the water in the river is poisoned.

Kir, you'll have to go to Karansul and find out what and how, after all it's definitely his doing.
