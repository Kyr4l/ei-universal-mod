Enter the city
There is a tireless guard of dead men guarding the gates of the Dead City. However, there is a hidden passage through a cleft to the south in the mountains that is protected by the element of earth. It is slow and can be tricked by hailing it a little further from the ravine.

The lone mountain in the middle of the Dead City is the most noteworthy place. It's best to start your search from there.

Even if the witch isn't at the top of the mountain, you can view the area from there and try to spot her.
