Item constructor
You can use items from your inventory and from the store to create new items. You can do this in two ways. Either by using the appropriate diagrams and parts of goods or by recovering parts from your equipment. The price details of the operation can be found at the bottom of the left window. The buttons next to the window are used to confirm/cancel operations.
