Urk-Tar, I want to ask you something. Have any other aliens appeared here besides the ones you already told about?

#phrase OrcC 2
No, we killed-all of them. Shei-Var thought-thought they were demons. Clad in iron, weapons of iron. Invincible demons. But the Chosen One demon-demon killed. Urk-Tar thought: the Chosen-She-Var could, that means the strong-strong orc will be able to too.

And who is this Chosen One you keep talking about?

The Chosen One is the Chosen One! He came-from nowhere, the people called him the Chosen One. He helped people, he helped Shei-Var. Then he was lost. The people became evil, attacked the orcs, drove them from the Foothills. Completely evil.

Wait. What do you mean it came out of nowhere?

They say-they say he appeared in the ruins when nothing-nothing was there, and then-then the Chosen One appeared. Out of nowhere.

Well, there you go! Surely the Chosen One has teleported to Gipath. That means he's the Joon I'm looking for.

And where is the Chosen One now?

#phrase OrcC 9
Orcs-orcs don't know. He was looking for something-he was looking for something. Then the abyss. With certainty-with certainty, he found.

If there's a chance that the Chosen One is still here, you should try to find him.
