Fieruzie, you helped me a lot last time, I'm still marveling at how cleverly you handled it all.

Yeah, it's obvious right away that you need something from me again. But you didn't come here alone. And what, Kiel, can't you do it alone? Or will you finally admit that I'm the better thief?

You don't even expose yourself to me, you don't even know yet what Kir wants to offer you.

You have to infiltrate the courtyard of a certain mansion and open a certain chest there. All in all, it's nothing difficult.

No well, if Kiel had proposed then I would have still understood, what to do that girls foolish. But after all, only the insane would choose to enter such a guarded lineup!

Ha, and that's exactly how I thought you'd quit! You're scared! Well, admit it! You're a coward! Ha, ha!!!

Er, come on. Who says I quit? Eh... we just haven't worked out how much you guys are gonna pay me for this yet.

As for paying you, no way. That's a job for a real thief. It's a matter of honor, you might say.

Honorable, you say? All right, let it be. Only next time it will be you who helps me, because you never know how life might turn out.
