Kiel, you're such a badass! I can't believe we're free again! You know, I've never met a girl so resourceful, so smart-...

Yeah, yeah, I know. But still, it's nice to hear something like that again.

I'm so grateful to you. So that you don't know how! You saved not only me, but also the hope of saving my whole family!

This one... you're obviously a little out of sorts with your emotions. It's still too early to be happy, you still have to think about where to hide now. Hm... aren't you afraid of spiders and such, generally... bugs?

Where do you think spiders come from?

Well... because if you're afraid of those nice, hairy, eight-legged creatures, then I can't bring myself to visit my friends at Rindeil's mansion.

No, come on, I'm not afraid of any spiders. And when I was a kid I even read the Great Ziefius' treatise 'On Perfection with Eight Legs'...

Well, then I'll rest assured about you. You'll at least have something to talk about with Rindeil, I think, and because of that he'll be delighted with you because he's not interested in anything else. He owns the estate, but Karim manages everything there. Anyway, you'll see everything for yourself.

And I also want to ask you one more favor. Kiel is a proud girl, and she doesn't like to admit her failures. Also, at the mansion, try not to talk about the fact that I got into the slave pen next to the Portal. And especially that sly Fieruz. Remember - I trusted you.
