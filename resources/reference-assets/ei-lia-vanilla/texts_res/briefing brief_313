Oh I am happy to know that my knowledge proved useful! The old scroll did not deceive, there actually turned out to be herbs in the tomb!

Yes, we found the herbs. But their owner was not so lucky. They couldn't protect him! Your spell raised even him from the grave!

I dare say it doesn't work as a preventative measure against necromancy. But it is known to bring peace to those who have already risen from their graves.

Don't tell me we're supposed to fly all over the place and pour a bottle of magic on every dead person! There's not enough magic herbs for everyone. You better come up with something better!

Kiel, don't get so hot. I'm sure there's another way out. Right, necromancer!

Theoretically, there is a way out, not even one... For example, you could sacrifice a human and mix herbs with blood, then...

If I were you, Kiel would strain her brain and try to come up with something less radical.

Ah, and this would be such an interesting experiment... But there are also, um... less radical ways. Just pour some liquor over the main tomb in the cemetery, repeating the words in your mind: 'Dar, Daierat, Daierun'.
