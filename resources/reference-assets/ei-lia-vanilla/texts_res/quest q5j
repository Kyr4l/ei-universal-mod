The magic tincture
The necromancer from the Isle of Death said that the spell that revives the undead in the entire area can only be lifted with special herbs. Such herbs are probably on the island, in the tomb of one of the old heroes.

Make your way to the eastern island
The hero's tomb where the herbs are hidden is on the eastern island. You can only get there by crossing the ford between the islands.

Go to the tomb.
A great hero was buried on a high hill. The place is abandoned now, but the hill is claimed by dragons.

Take the herbs
The best way to do this: stand over the tomb, open it, find the bottle, grab it, and while still holding it, pull your hand back. It should work, although it sounds complicated.

Destroy the hero
The tincture bottle was well sealed and the herbs could not save its owner from a terrible fate. Now you have to appease this unfortunate man for all time....
