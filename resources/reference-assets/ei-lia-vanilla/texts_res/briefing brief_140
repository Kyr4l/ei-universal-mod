I can just see Babur's workshop has been demolished, and he himself is not here. What happened here?

At night, the orcs attacked us. By the time my boys grabbed their weapons, the trail behind them had already cooled. At first we were glad they got scared and ran away, but then we noticed Babur was gone.

But who attacked? Which orcs? And how were they able to get through the posts?

I have a suspicion. They were island orcs, definitely them. They slaughtered all the goblins, complete savages. The ones from the Middle Peaks they would just bribe, and slaughter them all. I almost feel sorry for them, those hooflegs.

And where did they take Babur?

And how is anyone supposed to know! You'd have to ask the orcs themselves. By the time such news reaches us, it may be too late.

Babur must be rescued immediately! Without him we can't get through the observatory.

You have to go to Urk-Tar quickly. He should know what happened to Babur.
