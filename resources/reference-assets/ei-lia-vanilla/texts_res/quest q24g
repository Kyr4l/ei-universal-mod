Dinner with the ogre
The island orcs who took Babur captive during an arrogant assault on the Free Hunters' camp have decided to give him as a gift to a nearby ogre tribe. Apparently the gifts find their way into the bellies of those involved rather quickly, and aside from Babur, no one will be able to make out the key to the gate in the Middle Peaks.

Get the first key
To open the lattice in the den you need two keys. One of them rests in the trunk of the ogre chief, whose hut is located on a high hill in the camp.

Free the craftsman
Babur along with other potential ogre snacks is kept in a small pit in the middle of the camp.

Babur must survive
You know why...
