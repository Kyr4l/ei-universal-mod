Lord Baron, we have quickly captured this cursed corpse-mage! No one has managed so far, and we once and done!     :D

#phrase Baron 2
And do you understand that you have dared to attack the enemy arbitrarily, and without my permission have undertaken an excursion and taken a prisoner? Well... but your initiative was successful, and as you know, the victors are not judged.

#phrase Hero 4
We apologize most sincerely, Mr. Baron, and with a sincere oath we promise: nothing like this will ever happen again!

It won't happen again, just... just wait! You have to act specifically, not like a fly in the ointment...
