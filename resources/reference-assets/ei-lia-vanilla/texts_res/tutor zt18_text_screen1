     To use a potion or a wand you bought or found you must first hand it over to one of your characters in "camp".

     The potion will then be available to the character and will appear in the appropriate framed screen. To use it, just click on its icon or use the following keyboard keys:

     Use item 1 - <P> key.
     Use item 2 - <O> key.
     Use item 3 - <I> key.
     Use item 4 - <U> key.
