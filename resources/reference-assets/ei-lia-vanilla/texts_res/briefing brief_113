Tyn-Acheiu, and where is the leader? I have the Shell, and from what I noticed the lizards actually became very aggressive immediately after it disappeared.

Urk-Tar has taken the warriors and gone-away. He raids the people, reclaims the encampment. You too go-go. Help!

They came, they attacked-they attacked the encampment. They killed everyone. Warriors, children, old men!

Kir, do as you wish, but I will go with Urk-Tar. The Orcs have related to us very well, we should help them reclaim their lands. Furthermore, these people have simply behaved like pigs.

Well, when you think about it, people behave like this very often. There's no surprise here. All right, we'll go together. We'll retake the camp and make sure the orcs don't become too much like humans in their bloodlust.
