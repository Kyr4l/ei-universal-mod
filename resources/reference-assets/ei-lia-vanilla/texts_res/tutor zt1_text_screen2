     Your character is now in a Game zone. If you want him to walk somewhere just click on the point and he will go there. If you double-click on the point, he will run there.

     Note: your character cannot always travel through all parts of the Game zone. If you try sending him to a point he can't reach he'll either go to the nearest accessible point or simply remain where he was.
