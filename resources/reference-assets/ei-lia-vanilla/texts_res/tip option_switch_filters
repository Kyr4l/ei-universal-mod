Autofilters
You can use inventory filters to display only 
those items belonging to a particular category. 
These filers may be activated only manually 
or both manually and automatically.
On: the filters will be switched on automatically 
every time a new item is put into inventory 
(according to the item type).
Off: the filers will be switched on/off only 
manually.
