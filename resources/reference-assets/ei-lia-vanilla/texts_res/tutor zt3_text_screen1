     To progress in the game you'll have to complete many different quests - some are necessary and some are optional. These quests give your character additional experience and other benefits.

     When you receive a new quest you'll hear a sound and see a message in the Text window. Detailed information will also be available in the Quests screen - see the next tutorial screen for more on this.
