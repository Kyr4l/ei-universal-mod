Priest of Silence
The Khadagans captured their priest during a recent raid into a robalogl's cave. He now sits in one of the cells in the necromancer's fortress, where he will be tortured and experiments will be performed on him.

Find the robber's cell
There are three entrances to the fortress. The eastern one is the least defended, but the cell where they keep the priest is the furthest from it, which is near the northwest wall of the fortress.
#subobj 2
Free the robber
You don't need a key or a lock pick to lift the cell's bars.

Escort the robber to the cave
A worm-head who has never been to the surface before will not be able to find his way to the underground on his own.

Priest of Silence must survive
