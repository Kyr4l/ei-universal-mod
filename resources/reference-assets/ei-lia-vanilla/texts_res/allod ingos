Ingos
Ingos is a part of the Canian Empire. Its territory is vast and sparsely populated, so it is also inhabited by other races and tribes. Ingos is divided into districts governed by governors, who are assisted by guards sent from the capital. However, the inhabitants of Ingos enjoy relative freedom. They are famous among other peoples for their love of freedom and disrespect for any authority.
