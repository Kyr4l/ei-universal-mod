     To deconstruct an item, click on it and it will appear in one of the constructor's slots reserved for ready-made items. In the lower-left corner of the screen you'll see the total cost of deconstructing it.

To deconstruct the item click on the "V" button
To cancel click on the "X" button

     Note: if you deconstruct an item and then construct it immediately afterwards you'll still be charged for constructing and deconstructing - a serious waste of money, so be careful.
