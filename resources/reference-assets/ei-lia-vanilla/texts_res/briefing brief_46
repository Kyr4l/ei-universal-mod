Aliya, you seem concerned. Has something happened?

You're guessing right. Yes, I was caused quite a bit of worry. My friend is gone! When I was captured by the soldiers Sahilla managed to escape, and I hoped to meet her here. But it's been a long time and she's still missing.

Well, maybe she's hiding somewhere? There's a lot of soldiers around, she could be hiding somewhere for a while.

No, I feel with my heart that something has happened to her. I am going to go in search of her.

I can't believe my ears! Kir, don't you have enough worries of your own? Or are you going to throw yourself into doing favors for the sake of every pretty face!

Kiel, I'm amazed by your attitude. Anyway, if this is too dangerous for you then you can stay here.

Well, no, if I let you go alone, you'll get into trouble again! I'm coming with you, and don't even try to leave me here!
