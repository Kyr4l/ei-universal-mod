The orcs have bred a giant ogre! I'm told they keep it on the islands, specially fed. Oh, what happens now? What if he runs away from them? The biggest ogre in all of Gipath!

Yes, that is indeed not good. But how do you defeat such a giant ogre?

I've also heard that the bigger the ogres, the hungrier they are for food. What you don't give them, they'll eat it all. You just have to know how much you can fit in.
