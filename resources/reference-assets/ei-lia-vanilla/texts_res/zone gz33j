Fortress of Dar-Ugorn
This fortress used to belong to Cania, but was abandoned not long ago. The fortress of Dar-Ugorn was occupied by Khadagan warriors and the surrounding area was ruined. Only wraiths cultivate the fields, as necromancers have turned all the peasants into zombies. These monsters provide food for the garrisons.
