Chief, I'm trying to find evidence to justify the old magician. But I know too little and suspect too many. The forest is your home, no one knows it better than you. Tell me, have you seen anything strange lately?

Will it be strange if you meet a tiger with red skin? We often see people in the forest who behave in ways that are strange for the Forest People to understand. We saw that a strange man came to the place where we found Brissen's corpse. He was looking for something there.

Kir, we should search the place. I'm sure we can find something important!

An owl hunts in the dark of night, but the slightest rustle will tell it where its prey is. We saw a man hiding something in the woods. Does that give you anything?

No. It's definitely one of the hunters, everyone here has a stash in the woods. But to search the crime scene is a good thought.
