Ah Fazil, you don't understand anything. If I told you I was going for the cause alone, you wouldn't go with me for anything. But I had to take revenge for my sister's death! To one who has not spared her and such an end is not a fitting punishment. Oh, then you don't know what a heroic thing to do with him? You don't know... it's all right, you'll sleep better.
