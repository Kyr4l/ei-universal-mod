Kiel, what happened? You've been silent all the way.

Nothing.

I can see that. Speak up! Did someone insult you? If so, he's already dead.

Then go ahead and hang yourself.

I don't understand. You're mad at me? For what? I don't understand. At least explain.

There's nothing to explain here. I'm just confused! I'm embarrassed that for the sake of anything you decide to go against the odds! And for what? You could have died if the clairvoyant had noticed the theft. It makes me angry that you're risking yourself for the sake of anyone who looks in your direction. But you don't notice that there are others who are willing to sacrifice themselves for you...

No one's going to sacrifice themselves for my sake! Kiel, you sure are getting tired a lot. If you'd like, you can stay with Airy while I continue my search.

Well, no, with this hysterical, capricious girl I'm definitely not staying. I'm better off putting up with your crazy antics than being next to Aira.
