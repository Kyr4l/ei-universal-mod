     The Available Abilities panel (framed) shows a list of abilities your character can learn. The number next to the ability name is the cost of learning this ability. If the price is dimmed it means you lack the required experience to do so.
     To learn more about an ability, place the cursor over it and read the text that appears in the Descriptions panel.

     To give your character an ability, click on the button with its price in the "Available Abilities" section.
     To confirm or cancel, click on the appropriate buttons in the "Your Experience" section.

     Note: each ability you learn significantly increases the price of learning other abilities. This means your character will not be able to learn all available abilities. A key to success in the game is selecting the right abilities.
