You again! I was hoping such a talker wouldn't survive in Death Canyon! You sure have puzzled your enemies to death, huh? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

But no, Sergeant! I fought with all my might just to become a soldier in the great army of the Khadagan Empire! Ever since I was a child, I dreamed of becoming a soldier! It's a great honor for me! I... for my friend too!

Son, how pleasant to hear such words! I have been watching you and your friend. You have indeed fought well. And I have a task for just such young but effective soldiers.

At your command, Sergeant!

You have to go to the Useless Lands with orders for the head of the expedition. They must be having a picnic there, because they don't send reports or messengers. Give them the orders, wait for them to write back and give the answer to the messenger who will follow you in a while!

And also: go to the depot, there they will issue you new uniforms. Why destroy your private clothing on duty? And leave your items here. And don't worry, nothing will happen to them. I'll personally see to it.

Oh well, since we're going to leave our stuff here anyway, Kiel would advise Kira to sell anything unnecessary. Money even in the Useless Lands is money!
