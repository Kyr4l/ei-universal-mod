     You are currently in the "Global map". This is an overview of the island your character is on. It shows what Game zones are available (their borders are marked with a yellow frame). A zone becomes "available" if your character visits it at least once, or if he receives a quest to complete there.

     Your character's current position is indicated with a "floating" vertical arrow.

     You can rotate the Global Map in any direction you wish. The buttons at the bottom right of the screen control this.

     The name of the island and the game time are shown in the upper-left corner of the screen. In the lower-left corner there's a "camp entrance" button. Click on this to see what items you have obtained, or to change your characters' weapons and armor, take on new items etc.
