     To find out what topics you can discuss with a character, click on him/her and you'll see a list. Click on the topic you want to use for your conversation.

     Note: depending on which topic you choose, other topics in the list may change or disappear altogether.

     Conversation topics can give you a new quest, advice, or even a gift. They're typically informative, or rewarding, so seek out talkative characters whenever possible.

     Note: some characters may have the "buy, sell, order..." topic in their list. If you click on it you'll go right to the Shop Screen. See the other tutorials for more on buying/selling.
