Kiel, so you were talking about running away? I want to get out of here as soon as possible.

Well, you've finally figured out that the only way out of here is to run! Hold on, Kiel, I won't let you die!

Yeah, I figured you were pretty smart. So what's your plan?

Yesterday I managed to overhear the conversation of the officers: it turns out that they have a map of the catacombs, with which you can get to the other side of the hills. And from there it's a stone's throw to town! All in all, it's easy!

Oh, easy... all we have to do is steal this map from the officer and make our way to the catacombs, bypassing the guards. But first it's up to us to get out of this enclosure.

Out of the corral? A... that's what I need you for.

No, and I don't burn to observe such. Just in case, stay close, I feel something bad is about to happen.
