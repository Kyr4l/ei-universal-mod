Just in time you kids came running! We could have done without you, but you made it quicker.

And why are you crawling around in front of them! They're spies after all! Hang them! It's written on their foreheads: Valrasian spy! Hang them!

Crooked, shut the fuck up. Nobody asked you at all.

#phrase Gerald 4
But the question remains. Where did you come from? To us, the rulers of animals, no one is taking any chances. Or, not to put it nicely, you're as desperate as we are, but Crooked is right and you're spies. Well, answer me!

We are not spies. I'm Kir, the girl with me - Kiel. We're looking for Brissen, or more specifically his friend, the mage.

I don't believe them at all! They could have set tigers on us just to gain our trust. And how did they know Brissen was here? Suspicious! I have a rope ready, by the way! Shall we hang them?

Get out of my sight until I hang you myself!

Well, let's put them to some kind of test!

Heh, first reasonable suggestion!

Also kids if you can stand this test, we'll take you on. And if not... ...then Crooked's line will come in handy.
