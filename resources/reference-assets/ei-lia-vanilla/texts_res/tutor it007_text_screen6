     The bar at the top of the screen shows which spells are available to your character during quests. The bar at the bottom shows your inventory.
     
     Your inventory contains some ready-made spells. To hand one of these spells over to your character, click on its icon in the bottom bar.
     To take a spell from your character and return it to your inventory click on the spell's icon in the top bar.

     Note: if a spell is too complex for your character's knowledge of this particular school of magic (Elemental Magic, Sensory Magic, Astral Magic) the spell will be dimmed and you will be unable to hand it to your character. The same applies when your character cannot use a spell because he lacks the stamina to do so.
