Babur, just like you said, I searched the tombs in the lizard graveyard. But all I found there was a crowd of unknown living lizards, and some rusty shrapnel.

And what did you do with those lizards?

Like what... figure it out yourself!

All right, I finally see how many lizard skins you brought. Just right. That means your armor will be strong now.

You're the one who tricked me? You said you needed a needle and told you to go no where past the rust shard! And in reality you only needed material!

Well, whether I cheated or not is still up for debate. But now you'll have good armor. Is that more important to you? Or that I made up the needle thing? I'm not forcing you, you can go to another craftsman.

Agreed Babura, I don't want to argue over such nonsense. Make me armor and I will be very grateful to you.
