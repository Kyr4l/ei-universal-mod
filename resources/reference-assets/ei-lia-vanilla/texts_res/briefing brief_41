Khatul! Will you take me and my friends in for a time or will you say we are too dangerous for your Hideout?

Aliyo, you acted too hastily by coming here while they are looking for you, and yet you brought strangers to us. After all, you know there's a hefty reward for exposing us!

You haven't changed one bit. I can vouch for my friends. They saved me from prison. Or does that mean nothing to you either?

For the chance to discover The Last Hideout, the authorities could release many a prisoner from jail. One should not blindly believe even one who appears to be truthful.

Brother Khatul, let me interject. You may not trust me, but I am willing to swear to whatever you want that I am not anyone's spy. And if you wish, put me to the test!

Well, what do you say to that Khatulu? Can you manage to come up with a worthy trial for him? Or are you even afraid to do that?

Aliya, you are confusing cowardice with caution. The Great Powers would not help us if we did not take care of ourselves. I will invent a suitable trial for strangers.
