Oh, my young friend! Are you rushing to see my collection? I feel honored by it.

Well, no, unfortunately, I'm worried about something else. Kiel and I escaped, but they'll be looking for us. I've kind of figured out that they don't just let slaves go.

Yeah, you're right, my boy, I've thought about that too. But what to do I don't know. Maybe you have an idea?

I'm afraid there are records left with the clerk about the red-skinned slave and the young girl. Those records would have to be stolen or destroyed...

Yes, you are right again, my boy! You need to get through to the house of the chief warden, you will easily recognize this building - there are always officials hanging around next to it - and there you need to steal the records that mention slaves. Perhaps without the records no one will start looking for escaped slaves. I wish you luck, my heart is with you.
