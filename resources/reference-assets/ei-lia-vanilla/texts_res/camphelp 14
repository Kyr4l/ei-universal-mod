Schema
This section contains the schematics needed to create new items. When you place a schematic here, you will still need to enter the appropriate amount of materials in the "Materials" section. Then you will be able to create a new item, which will appear in the "Finished items" section. You can also disassemble items that you have - then, in this section, you will find the schematic of the disassembled item.
