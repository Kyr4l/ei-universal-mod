     Each item has a certain "durability". Items that are in full working order have a Maximum durability value, while items that are no longer usable (due to wear and tear, for example), have zero durability. In this screen you can repair items and restore their durability to the Maximum value.

     If you're in the Game zone and an item is damaged so badly that it is about to become unusable, you'll be warned by a special sound which you'll hear as soon as you try using the item (strike in the case of a weapon, or receive blows if it's a piece of armor). When you hear this sound you need to base and repair the item before it becomes completely unusable.
     To repair an item place it on the table in the middle of the screen. The lower-left panel will show the price to repair it. You can accept the cost and repair the item by clicking the "V" button, or cancel with the "X" button.

     Note: items which become unusable will be moved into inventory and will be inaccessible for your characters. So maintain all your characters' equipment in good working order or you'll be at a distinct disadvantage.
