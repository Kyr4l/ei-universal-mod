Everything's beautiful! We, in the literal sense of the word, chased this defecator out of his burrow. But his skin was turning blue! But without your advice, we wouldn't have been able to find the necromancer ourselves.

Oh, I asked not to speak! But I'm glad anyway. I'm tired of sitting here without anything to do. It's good that at least the trade brings some profit. Soldiers are like children, they like candy too.

That's how I learned that the Khadagans were preparing an assault on Dar-Ulgorn. I managed to warn the baron in time, and our losses were minimal! And so it began. I realized then that espionage is my calling!
