     In the item shop you can buy and sell weapons, armor, materials, blueprints and collected items. Quest items can not be bought or sold.

     The bar at the top of the screen shows what's available in the shop, while the bottom bar shows what you have in your inventory. Use the buttons on either side of the bars to choose the type of objects you wish displayed.

     The middle of the screen is used as the "shop counter". The top half of the counter contains the items you are buying, the bottom half contains items you are selling. The lower-left section of the screen shows the total "deal value". This is the amount you can get from the deal (if you're selling) or must pay (if you're buying).

     To put an item on the shop counter click on its picture in the appropriate bar (top or bottom).
     To put the item back onto the bar click on it while it's on the shop counter.
     To move several items of the same kind press the <SHIFT> key when you click on an item.
     To complete the deal click the "V" button next to the deal value, or click "X" to cancel.
