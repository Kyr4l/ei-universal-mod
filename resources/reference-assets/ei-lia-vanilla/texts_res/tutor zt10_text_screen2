     To control the Mini-map use the buttons to the right (they're framed). You can zoom in and out or set the camera to a default direction.

     To zoom in/out use the <+>/<-> keys
     To set the camera facing North use the <N> key or the "N" button.
     To show/hide the Mini-map use the framed upper-right button or the <M> key.

     Note:  When the camera is set to "North", the terrain's orientation on the game screen is the same as in the Mini-map.
