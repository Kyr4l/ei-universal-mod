A gift for the governor
Governor Valrasian mentioned that it would be good to give him an arrow of the Blue Clan's forest people magician as a gift. You have to try to get this arrow - displeasing the governor will not lead to anything good.

Go into the lands of the Blue clan
The forest people of the Blue clan live in the southwest of the mine zone.

Find the Mage of the Forest People
There are many forest people of the Blue clan shooters, but the mage, holder of the necessary arrow, is only one.

Take the arrow
The forest people mage uses spells and does not shoot from a tube. It is not worth hoping that he will fire it at someone and then it can be taken away. Therefore, you need to steal it or take it from a corpse.
