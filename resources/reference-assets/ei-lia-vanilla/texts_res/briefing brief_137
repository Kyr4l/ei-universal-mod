Not that I want to pry, but Grandma sure forgot that the ball broke down after use, and all its magical power flew out of it.

Not that one! So what to do now? We're not gonna bring Tka-Rick a broken ball! Maybe we should ask a witch.

Oh, and you know something? Can you tell us how to fix a bullet?

No. But there's a ruined observatory across the lake in the Middle Peaks where you can find lots of useful things. I would go there if I were you.

And you don't want to help us? While we'd be going for the bullet, you'd be running to the observatory.

And yet what, I have so many things on my mind! And anyway, the road there is locked with a gate, and I don't have the key to it. And it's dangerous there, they say mountain lizards have nested there.

It's nothing, I think the key can go ask Babur to do it, and we can deal with the lizards too. Thank you Airy, you are very wise!
