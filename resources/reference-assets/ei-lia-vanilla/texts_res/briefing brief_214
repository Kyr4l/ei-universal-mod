Don't be angry that we don't believe you. Our accommodation is like a sore thumb to Valrasian - ... let's say a heel. He thinks we are highwaymen, and sometimes sends spies to us.

#phrase Gerald 2
We just don't want to depend on someone and live alone. We have learned to tame animals, and they serve us. And we don't bother anyone!

Well, now about the task. Quite near here a caravan of goods will soon be passing through to the capital. Trickster, tell the children the details of the matter.

All too simple. This time Valrasian has prepared a giant nugget as a gift. They say it was given to him by a boy. But that's not important. The important thing is that we find a better use for this nugget before those rich guys in the capital.

At the Karansula property, the caravan will make a stop. There it will be best to take out the nugget. It's important not to make any noise, so the caravan and security won't guess that the trunk is empty.

It's simple! You bring a nugget, we'll welcome you as a friend. If you don't bring one, you know. And don't think of running away!
