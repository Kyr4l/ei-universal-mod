Item store
At the top and bottom of the screen you will find scrolling windows. They contain the items available in the store and those in your pocket. "Shop counter" is located in the middle of the screen, and in the bottom left corner of the screen you will find the prices of goods to buy or sell. Click on the buttons next to the prices of the goods to make transactions or cancel them (in this case, the goods will be returned to the store).
