In our house there has always been a general fund - money that we kept just in case. We started collecting it a long time ago and now a large amount has accumulated. I kept all the money at my house, and they knew all about it.

But recently they were all gone. At first I started to notice that there was less and less, but I thought I had made a mistake in my bills and didn't pay attention to it. But now the whole bag is gone!

I've already told the whole story so everyone knows that a disgusting mole has taken root among us. If you're interested, Baldie suspects you.

After all, we didn't even know about the money! Kir, we need to talk urgently. I have an idea! Don't worry Geraldine, we'll find your mole and maybe something else....
