Airy, try on this necklace. It's the same one worn by the clairvoyant cave orcs.

Is it the same one? Yes, I can feel how much magical power can be sensed in it!

I'm so glad you like the necklace. But its beauty pales in comparison to the sparkle of your eyes, your velvety skin and your kind smile. One look from you is the best reward for me.

It's a shame, but maybe there's at least a little place for me too? It seems to me that it was to meet you that I made this long journey.

Don't get your hopes up. And to find your love you don't have to walk far at all, just look!
