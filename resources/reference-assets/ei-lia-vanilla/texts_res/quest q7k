One of Karansula's manufactures dumps harmful waste into the neighboring water basin and as a result, the forest animals living nearby have started to contract various diseases. The pollution of the river must be stopped, otherwise all the animals will become extinct.

Go to the manufactory area
To get to Karansula area you need to bypass the northern or southern security post. The northern one is very well protected, so it is better to go through the southern one.

Take the powder
Karansul told that the mountain work uses a special powder that can smash the whole mountain. And since it can smash rocks, it can handle one manmade mountain too.

Blow up the manufactory!
