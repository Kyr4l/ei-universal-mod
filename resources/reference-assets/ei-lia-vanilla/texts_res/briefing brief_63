Aunt Zaro, I feel awkward saying this, but somehow you look suspiciously strange.

Kir! How can you say such a thing to a woman! Aunt Zaro, you are definitely in love! I know what that absent-minded look and distracted smile means!

Oh girl, you are holy right! I met such a wonderful man! And just imagine, he's a scientist, he works for the emperor. And such a handsome man he is!

We're very excited about this. You'll probably invite us to your wedding soon, I hope?

Ah children, everything is so complicated. He's busy now, and he's suffering. Some zealot, necromancer Kehel, is trying to mess up my beloved's experiments. And guess what? He's trying on the position of leader of the Necromancer's Guild, but only my beloved is worthy of that honor!

You're right, but I know what needs to be done. Help me free myself from this Kehel, and I'll already find a way to pay you back!

What do you suggest I do with him? Kill a powerful necromancer? You've got to be kidding me.

No! Something simpler. I've procured a special scroll to tarnish the reputation of that necromancer and set the entire Guild against him. You can do it! I believe in you for a reason!
