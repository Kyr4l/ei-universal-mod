Jamanin, you got lucky. The magic herbs actually worked on your dead men through the graveyard soil and calmed them down. But if your advice turned out to be useless, things would not be rosy with you.

Don't be angry with me. Haven't I proven myself right yet?

You don't seem like much of a necromancer to me... you're so pathetic. I just can't believe you managed to reanimate that many undead.

I'm a theorist, not a practitioner like that zealot Firez, but that doesn't mean I'm weak!

And the brightest lord was good enough to let me continue practicing!

That's something not like the Baron. You didn't by any chance enchant him?

Your suspicions are off. I just managed to show Mr. Baron that astral magic, of which necromancy is partly composed, not only summons death but vice versa! Though I lack practice, I can already create protective and healing spells.

I have never yet met a single necromancer in the service of Cania. You are certainly the first. Your let and weak abilities but extensive knowledge could indeed come in handy.

I am happy to have the opportunity to use them and serve the Baron. I have realized one simple truth: there is little use in knowing the dead. But much from practically changing your habits.
