Yes, I have come to agree with this young man's evidence. I am compelled to express my deepest apologies for any possible inconvenience.

Inconveniences? And what are you talking about? On the contrary, I'm the one who should be thanking you, Governor Valrasian!

No, Mr. Governor was good enough to let me use his library, and it's just amazing!

In the old reports, the first ones made when this province was first surveyed, it says that here was a road to another land. Having compared this with my own data and historical maps, I realized that the artifact we were looking for and this road were one and the same.

Not quite. It's all hard to explain because he literally doesn't exist. Until I stumbled upon the old records it didn't feel like there was another passage located here. But about that later. In the meantime, I want to wash up and eat properly. I'll meet you at the lodge.
