Ha, ha, ha! Me clairvoyant? No. I am Karim, Rindeil's assistant, and my most important duty is to know everything about what is happening in this mansion. Also, my friend, if you need any help, please do. If I can - I will help.

Thank you, but I don't need anything temporarily. And you don't have to shout like that, I'm not deaf.

Oh, sorry. It's a habit. From my childhood years at the circus.... what a time that was! People came to our shows even from faraway accommodations! And the clairvoyant you say... we had one. He could read thoughts from a distance! Eh... But you must be in a hurry, I won't keep you. But come whenever you want, we'll talk.
