Kir, your luck and persistence will go into the legends of our race. I see you brought the ball.

Hold it tighter and look carefully. It will now show us Jygran, and open up the knowledge of it.

What it is. It has become white and cool. What does it mean? Is the sphere not working?

No, it's working, I can feel it. You have to understand what it means, White and cold.... not an easy task... also let me touch the bullet. Of course! The sphere points to Ingos! The bullet showed us the snow.

Even the sphere couldn't show us Jygran, but it gave us a hint. Snow - that means Ingos. The remote province of Cania.

Tka-Rick, I can't keep up with you. Tell me everything in detail.

I can draw the conclusion that the key to Jygran is located on Ingos. I cannot say what it is, but I feel that it contains great power. Perhaps it is a magical weapon or perhaps something else. It falls to you to explain it on the spot.

What will it take for us to go somewhere?

I'm afraid you're gonna stay here. You won't be able to follow your friend.

No, and that's it. Either the two of us go or I'll run after him one way or another. You guys can't stop me!

I don't think there's much point in arguing here. Kiel won't back down from what he wants anyway.

All right, since you're asking for it too, let's have it your way. You two go to Ingos.
