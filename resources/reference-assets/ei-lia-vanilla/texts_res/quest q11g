The Great Mage
Hermit the lizard told us that the Chosen One headed for the cave of the Great Mage of Gipath before he disappeared. The Chosen One went there through some sort of tunnel, but now you can also go on the surface - through a ravine in the east of the Distant Peaks.

Go to the ravine
The path to the Great Mage's cave goes through a long and winding gorge in the mountains. The entrance to the gorge is in the east of Distant Peaks.

Go through the gorge
The road from the gorge will exit to the lake in the center of Distant Peaks. You may encounter dangerous creatures in the mountains along the way to the exit.

Enter the cave of the Great Mage
The entrance to the cave where the Great Mage Gipath lives is just north of the lake.
