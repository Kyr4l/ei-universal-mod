Two Rivers
This area got its name because of the two rivers flowing through it. Previously, there was a city in between the rivers, but the war turned it into ruins and the massacred inhabitants began to forage. The place between these rivers is strategic, which is why a powerful Cadagan camp is located in the ruins.
