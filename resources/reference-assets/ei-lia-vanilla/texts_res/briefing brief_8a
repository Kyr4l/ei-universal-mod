There, I'm listening. And please: don't shout like that!

Oh, sorry. Say: and why do you have skin of such a strange red hue? I haven't seen one like it on you once.

Nothing weird about it. I am of the Joon race, that explains everything. But the fact that you have not once seen the likes of me only confirms my assumption that on Suslanger, and perhaps in all of Khadagan, the existence of the Joons has been forgotten.

Good people, you just look at this boy. He hasn't checked yet, hasn't asked Karim - and he's already jumping to conclusions! Kir, you are strongly mistaken! Now I just remembered that quite recently I heard somewhere about the fact that Khadagan scientists were engaged in the research of an unusual red-skinned young man, and this... what's his name... o! - phenomenon associated with him!

Only Joons have red skin! That was Joon! And where is he now? Who did you hear that from? What kind of phenomenon is this?

Don't be in such a hurry. I myself don't remember who told me about it - whether a peddler in the market or a drunken soldier over a glass of wine. But if you give me time, I will find out everything in detail and tell you. Just give me time!
