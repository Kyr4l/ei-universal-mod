We are faced with a choice: we can go to the Governor's Magician or we can try to find a friend for that elusive Brissen.

My inner voice tells me it's better not to get involved with the authorities. But why don't we try to find another magician?

And if that sleazy trader doesn't like him, there's a chance the mage might turn out to be a decent human being! Believe me, Kiel has had dealings with traders before, I know them inside out.

I don't doubt that anymore. It's just that it'll be easier for us to meet with Hys. His lab isn't far from here, and that mage still needs to be found.

Yeah, that's what we're gonna do. We'll go to Hys, and if nothing comes up with him we'll look for Brissen and his friend.

Suit yourself, but I warned you that nothing good would come of it.
