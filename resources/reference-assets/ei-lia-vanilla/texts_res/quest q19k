Material for the key
To produce a key, the Clever Man needs a magical material that can only be obtained from the most remote ravines in the mountains.

Enter the ravine
To enter the gorge you must go through the gates in the southeast of the town area.
#subobj 2
Cross the ravine
Suitable material can only be found at the very end of the ravine.
#subobj 3
Get the material
The Trickster was wrong - the material does not have magical properties, but as evidence, the sample should be taken anyway.
