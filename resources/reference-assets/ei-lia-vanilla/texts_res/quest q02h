Get the plan of the underground passage
There is not even the slightest chance of getting through the main gate. However, according to Kiel, there is another way out - through the old underground passage. Unfortunately she doesn't know how to get there, but the plans of this place should be at one of the officers.

Get to the underground passage
It turns out that a hidden underground passage is hidden under a seemingly ordinary house in the west of the fortress. It's high time to use it!
