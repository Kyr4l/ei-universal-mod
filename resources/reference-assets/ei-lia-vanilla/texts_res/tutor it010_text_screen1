     In the spell shop you can buy and sell ready-made spells, keystones and runes. Items are not for sale here.

     The top screen bar shows what's available in the shop, the bottom bar shows what you have in your inventory. Use the buttons on either side of the bars to choose the type of objects you wish displayed, such as keystones of a particular magic school, runes of a certain type or ready-made spells.

     In the middle of the screen is the "shop counter". The top half is used for the spells and runes you are buying, while the bottom half is for the ones you are selling. The lower-left section of the screen shows the total "deal value". This is the amount you can get (if you're selling) or the amount you must pay (if you're buying).

     To move a spell or rune onto the shop counter click on its picture in the appropriate bar (top or bottom).
     To put the spell or rune back to its original bar click on it while it's on the shop counter.
     To move several spells or runes of the same kind press the <SHIFT> key and click on the appropriate slot.
     To complete the deal click on the "V" button next to the deal value. 
     To cancel, click the "X" button.
