Okay, where were we? Ah yes, Portal. Initial review of the materials led me to conclude that we would encounter a problem. More specifically, an obstacle.

Judging by the documents I found, after some time the way to the portal was blocked by gates. Data on who put them there and for what purpose are absent. But I managed to find sketches of the gate itself and the lock to it. Incredible craftsmanship. Once upon a time this was known as the essence of real magic!

Ha! I'm willing to bet whatever you want that we're no worse off. The lock is complicated, of course, but I'd be willing to produce a key to it.

Trickster, that would be just great!

And I'm curious to see what I get out of it myself. Only that for such a lock the key should not be a simple one. For it I need a magic ore. And such is only found in the far ravine, southeast of the city.

I'll go get the ore right away!
