Hey, and who are you guys? How did you guys get here? Did you walk past the traps and they didn't work?

Don't worry, pretty, the traps are fine, Babur just showed us the way. We came to the witch Esther for advice. My name is Kir, and this is Kiel. And surely you are Esther's granddaughter, Airy?

No, I can get my own, I just don't want to. But I do know that the prettiest and most powerful magic necklace has the clairvoyant of the cave orcs. The entrance to their cave is in the northeastern part of Podgórze. Only my grandmother won't let me go there, she says I'm still too young.

You might not wait for her to come back and go get her yourself. She went to the Dead City, to the host of the city - a talking dragon.
