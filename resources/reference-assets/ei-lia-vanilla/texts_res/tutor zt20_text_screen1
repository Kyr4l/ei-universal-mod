     You can control up to three characters at the same time. You can control them together or each of them individually. To control characters individually you must select the character(s) to whom you wish to give commands.

     To select one character click on him/her in the Game zone or on his/her picture at the bottom of the screen.
     To select several characters do the same as above while holding down the <SHIFT> key.
     You can also select one or more characters by making a frame around them with the mouse while keeping the left button pressed. All characters within the frame will be selected.
     You can select individual characters or all characters using the keyboard as follows:

     To select character 1: <F1> key.
     To select character 2: <F2> key.
     To select character 3: <F3> key.
     To select all characters: <F4> key.

     Note: the moment you select a character (whether you do it by double-clicking on his/her picture or by pressing the <ALT> key) the camera will start tracking that character immediately.
