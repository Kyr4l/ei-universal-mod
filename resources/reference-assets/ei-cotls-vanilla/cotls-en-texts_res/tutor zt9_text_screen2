     In Defensive mode the character will stop fighting after the enemy has been killed or after another command has been issued to him, such as "cast a spell" or "move to another location". To resume combat you'll need to issue an attack command again.

     You can use this mode if the character needs to replenish stamina while there's an enemy nearby. A fighting character will not regenerate Stamina.
