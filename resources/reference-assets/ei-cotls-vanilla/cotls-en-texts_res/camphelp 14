Blueprint
This section holds the blueprints needed for constructing items. After you have placed a blueprint here, you will need to place the required amount of material in the "Materials" section. You can then construct a new item, which will appear in the "Ready-made items" section. You can also deconstruct any item you have. Once deconstructed, the item's blueprint will appear in this section.
