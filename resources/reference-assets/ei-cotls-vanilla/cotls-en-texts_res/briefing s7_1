And what about that Bald Island? Must be some Orc dump... Erfar, do you know anything about that place?
#ANIMATION 44

#phrase Elder  14
Very little: it is located somewhere in the southeast, they also call it "barren". But that is hardly going to help us: there is no way to cross the Orc bridges, and humans cannot get to the islands!

Mayhap they can, mayhap they cannot. If one can cross the cave bridge, why not the ones on the islands?
