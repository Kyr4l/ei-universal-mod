     If you need to get something from an enemy but don't want to risk fighting him, you can always try stealing it.
     Stealing from an enemy is a bit tricky. First off, you need to quietly approach him from behind and get as close to him as possible (its best to use the "sneak" mode, otherwise he could hear you coming).
     Once you've gotten close, click on the "Use/Steal" icon (it's currently highlighted) and the cursor will change shape. Place the new cursor over the item you want to steal and click again. When you've stolen what you wanted, you'll need to get a safe distance away from the enemy without him noticing (people tend to get a bit rancorous when they've been stolen from). Once you've gotten away you may move about normally.

     You can also select the "Use/Steal" skill with the <S> key on your keyboard.

     Note: not every attempt at stealing will be successful. Your result depends on your character's "Use/Steal" skill and on the properties of what you're trying to steal. The higher the "Use/Steal" skill your character has, the better your chances of success.
