     There are many different spells available in this game. Because it takes energy to cast spells, it diminishes your character's "Stamina"  (this is indicated by the blue bar under the character's picture). To replenish "Stamina" your character needs to rest, (standing still and not moving or fighting.)

     To cast a spell on any character, click on the spell's icon on the right edge of the screen, and then click on the character, or the character's portrait, if the target is one of your characters.
     To cast a spell on yourself simply double-click on the spell's icon.
