Seer and pyramid
The Orcs living in the Foothills feel secure because they are protected by a magic pyramid, controlled by a Seer.  If you kill this Seer and switch off the pyramid, this tribe will become far less dangerous.

Find the Seer
The Seer stands in the middle of the settlement to guard the switch. If you try to fight your way to him, the Orcs will come running in numbers from all around the place. However, you could try to crawl into the encampment so the guards will not see you.

Kill the Seer
