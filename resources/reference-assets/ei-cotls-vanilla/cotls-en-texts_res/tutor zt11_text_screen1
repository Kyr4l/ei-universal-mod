     The Text window (currently highlighted) has two modes: "messages" and "collected items". To switch between them use the buttons in the window's upper-left corner.

     In "messages" mode the Text window will contain information designed to give you a better understanding about what is happening in the game. This includes information about received and completed quests and missions, the items you've picked up, warnings about wear-and-tear on your weapons and armor and the characters' dialog lines.
     In "collected items" mode the Text window will show the total number of items you've picked up in the Game zone and give you information about them.
