Letter
The house of the owner of the collection is in the city, in the street leading from the northern gates and along the lake shore. The house you need is the one after the inn; you will know it by the two stone figures which stand near the door.

Enter the city
You can enter the city through the northern gate in the wall. Better do it at night or use the invisibility spell to get past the guards without attracting their attention. It would be very risky to engage in open combat with them.

Enter the house yard
The house you need is located in the street which leads south from the gates and along the lake. Like other houses it has a small fence, so you will have to enter the yard first.

Drop the letter
Just drop the letter to the collector in his house.
