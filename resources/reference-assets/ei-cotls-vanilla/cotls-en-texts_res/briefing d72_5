I... I do not know what to say, At-Zako. I have dreamt about you so often, and yet everything is not at all like I imagined it would be. You were so close - and I did not recognize you! Can you forgive me?!

I have nothing to forgive, my darling. It was not I who was close to you, it was Zak. Of course he was a decent fellow all in all, but honestly: I am very glad you did not let him get close to your heart.

And anyway, what does it matter now?! We are together, a great land welcomes us, we have a powerful protector behind our backs and it seems as if the sun rises in this world for you and me alone!

Do you not remember? You said almost the same thing when we escaped from the Curse the first time. Or thought we had escaped...

Yes, you are right. We cannot speak about happiness and peace while that Curse exists. But I swear there will come a time when I repeat the words about the whole world shining before us. And there will be no curse to worry about!
