I know that you are going to meet a man from the city. Take some advice...however secluded your meeting place may be, still take a very good look around first. You know the old saying..."divine forces help those who do not forget to take precautions."

Could you tell Brother Blondie where you meet the merchants from the city?

It is very easy to find. When you leave our catacombs and reach the city suburbs, go a short distance towards the sunrise and you will see a large wasteland surrounded by palm trees. That is the place, that is where I do business with the merchants.

Make sure no one sees you on the way! The guards may suspect nothing about the merchants' deliveries for the Brotherhood, but occasionally they do send patrols through the suburbs, just in case.

Those patrols are never too strong, so if you stumble upon some guards it will be easier to kill them than to wait until they trot off somewhere else!
