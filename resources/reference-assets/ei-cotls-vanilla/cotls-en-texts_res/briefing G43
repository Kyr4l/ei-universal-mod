Hello young man! Your face looks familiar... oh yes, Tilvar told me about you! You seek the Princess, hmm? I sincerely wish you the best of luck. I wanted very much to... get better acquainted with her... but those rogue kidnappers got there first...

But according to the Captain you did manage to find something else, did you not?

I found the Snoop's body in the forest near the farm...

What body? Oh that body... Tell Tilvar, let him deal with it. I employ him so I don't have to listen to horrible stories myself.

But the arrow is really beautiful. Perhaps... oh, no, how disappointing! I already have one like that in my collection.

Your collection is very famous.

And with good reason. I've collected a lot of very rare exhibits. I like young men who show proper respect to their elders. I'd be delighted to show you my exhibits.

I have very rare specimens here. Here is a Goblin sling, and this is an Orc axe. Have you ever seen an Orc, young man?

Thought so. Aahh, the past, the past... I can see myself now... in the heat of battle, I kill one, then another and lead my troops... Ooohhh!

But let us get back to our arrow...  Toad's curses! Where is my case with the Woodsfolk weapons?! It was the gem of my collection! Robbery! Treason!!! Get Captain Tilvar here immediately!

What is happening in my province? Girls kidnapped in the city, people murdered in the woods and I - I! - robbed in my own home!

Mayhap if Madame Diera had not insisted that she put her magic traps where my men used to stand on guard outside your home, then...

I do not need your excuses! Everyone, out, out! And get those exhibits back!

If there was an arrow like that in the case, mayhap it was the one shot at the Snoop? Then I must find the thief.
