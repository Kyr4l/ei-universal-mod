#phrase YCF  5
In the land which a person by the name of Karansul considers to be his domain. If you go to the rising sun you will see the Guards who guard Habbura.  The walls are high, the castle is strong and the Guards are cunning - but if you are strong and deft, you can bring Habbura back to us!
