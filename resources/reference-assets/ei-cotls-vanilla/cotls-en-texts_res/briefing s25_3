All right, cur, I will give you one chance to make your future a bit brighter. Just a little brighter, mind you, but better than nothing for someone in your situation.

This is the official alphabet of the Khadaganian Empire, and this paper is a kind of draft report. A unit... several soldiers and an official... A camp... A new camp near the Remote Mountains... And here is a coherent passage: it says that in the eastern part of the Remote Mountains there is a narrow passage in the rocks leading to the north. Oh, and that it leads to a dead end where there is a lever.

That lever is connected with a tunnel to the west of the ravine. If you press this lever it opens the entrance to the tunnel! The passage is winding and dangerous, crevices and dead ends are mentioned here...  It says that it is dangerous to venture too far to the east - Harpies live there.

Is that it?

No, there is more... there is danger inside the tunnel, but it does not specify what kind of danger. That is all it says.

Ha! Did you really hope that I would let you go in exchange for this nonsense? No, you will stay here until I decide what to do with you!
