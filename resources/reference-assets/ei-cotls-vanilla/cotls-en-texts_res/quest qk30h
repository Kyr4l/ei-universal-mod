Find the person with the key
To get inside the mansion you must have the key to the gates. One of the guards has it.

Get the key
The key holder is not very vigilant and occasionally stops for longish periods of time to stare straight ahead! The best plan would be to try and steal the key, rather than to attack him and risk the unwelcome attention of the guards.
