Good day to you, Sver! I wanted to thank you - you really helped and Karansul is like a brother to me now.

Do you trust him?

Actually, no. That is what I wanted to talk about. Karansul gave me the key to the gates of the pits east of the land of abandoned mines. He says I can find a golden nugget there. He could not make me that sort of present, could he?

Of course not! He wants to have you dead, that is that. I knew a man who used to work in those pits.

He was on the job as usual, when suddenly really vicious tigers appeared out of the blue, so the people just had to run away. So they ran. Slave drivers yelled at them to take the gold but the workers... well, you know how workers are when they are hard pressed.

So the gold all remained there and the Governor ordered the entrances to those pits sealed off. So there is indeed gold around there, but it is not easy to get at.

Well, I have not had it easy for as long as I can remember! But thanks for the warning anyway.
