Finding island Orcs' mechanism
A brigand was killed in the forest near Middle Mountains. He had managed to steal an Orc coffer containing a new mechanism . Without that mechanism you will not be able to lower the Orc drawbridge leading to the islands. The coffer lies in the forest very close to the beginning of the road to the Middle Mountains.

Find the coffer
The coffer has been abandoned in the forest somewhere near where the road to the Middle Mountains begins. Another landmark is the cart used by the Brigands to transport the coffer - that was before they started to fight each other....

Get the mechanism
The lock on the coffer is not difficult, you could open it with your bare hands without any special keys.
