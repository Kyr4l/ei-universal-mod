Listen Kharad, why not stay in Gipath? I cannot promise anything but I will ask the Great Magician to send you to the village...

No, Blondie, my heart calls me home and revenge still burns in my soul. I cannot abandon the brothers in the Last Shelter. I must get back to Suslanger. Fare thee well!

I understand: for you, duty comes above all else. Well goodbye, and may luck be with you!
