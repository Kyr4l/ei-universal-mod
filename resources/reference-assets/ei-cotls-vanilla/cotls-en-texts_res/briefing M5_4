God bless you, Chosen! Now we can walk in the Foothills safely. I promised to reward you, and I shall keep my word!

Oh by the way, where is your source of money here in Gipath? I was told there was no king here, but now I see genuine royal coins. How is this?

Well, that is no mystery. Gipath was not always the desolate place it is nowadays - in ancient times other people lived here, nothing like us, you understand! But they disappeared without a trace, leaving only ruins behind... And the coins - well, apparently that is their legacy.

So anyone who takes a good look around the ruins can become the first man in the village who is richer than you or Erfar?

That is a possibility, aye.  But the problem is, the easily accessible places have been cleaned out a long time ago. And elsewhere, there are more unpleasant things than money awaiting the unwary searcher...

So we cannot expect to see a lot of suddenly rich people in this area. And, by all the ruins of our unfortunate Gipath, I cannot say I am very unhappy about that!
