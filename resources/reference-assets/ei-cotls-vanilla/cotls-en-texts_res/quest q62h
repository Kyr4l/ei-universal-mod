Find the duty officer
The main gates of the southern fortress are locked and to open them you will need the key. The duty officer at the gates has it; you will have to find him (lieutenant Kardaur is going to be on duty). His post is near the gates.

Open the main gates
To open the main fortress gates use the key you took from Kardaur. After that make haste: the open gates will inevitably attract the guards' attention and the chase will start immediately.

Open cages
The gate keeper is also responsible for cages with wild spiders. Next to the gates there is a lever which opens all cages at once. If you do that the released spiders will attack the guards and that will certainly distract them for a while.
