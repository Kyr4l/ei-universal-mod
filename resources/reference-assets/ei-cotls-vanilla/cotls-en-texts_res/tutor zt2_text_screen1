     You have full control over of the camera throughout the game. You can turn it, move it, zoom in and out and follow a selected character. You'll also be able to see terrain and objects throughout the Game zone regardless of whether you've already explored them or not.

     To move the camera simply move the cursor to the screen edge or use the arrow keys.
     To turn the camera use the right mouse button or use the <CTRL> + arrow keys.
     To zoom in/out move the mouse wheel or use the <PgUp>/<PgDn> keys.
     To track a character double-click on the character's picture at the bottom of the screen, or press the <HOME> key.

     Note: you're in the tracking mode when you see a symbol on top of the character's picture. If you manually move the camera, tracking stops.
