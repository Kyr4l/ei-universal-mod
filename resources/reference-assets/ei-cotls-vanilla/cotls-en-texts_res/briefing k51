Captain, I have not given up my search for the Princess! I am close but I need a little help. Of course my gratitude would know no ends... eh... within reasonable limits, of course.

Young man, you could swear to give me all the reward money and I still would not agree to help you. I am well aware that there is also the rank of Guards' Lieutenant attached to that money and I do not need officers in my unit who are too independent and energetic.

Oh, I can easily drop any claims to that part of the reward!

And all others too! But if I dropped the word, Tilvar would start getting wrong ideas...

And we will split the money fifty-fifty: that is how much I am prepared to pay for information about the abandoned mines.

Oh, you think that is where the Princess is kept? In that case, young man, I can only disappoint you: the Governor blocked the way to the mines. But if you manage to get his Excellency interested he may clear the way for you, as a special favor.

However, if I were you I would not be very happy about that. The bad reputation these mines have is well founded: the miners disturbed the Lords of the Dungeons and everyone knows one should not play games with those beings!

What Lords and Masters? I do not know anything about them!

"The less you know the better you sleep", my friend. Those creatures are popularly known as Wormheads. They live deep under the ground. People who catch a glimpses of them just once have nightmares about their horrible appearance for months afterwards. They are intelligent, they know magic and have no mercy on strangers... in a word, young man, if you go into those mines you have my sincere sympathy!

And I will give you a word of advice, born of that sympathy... there are three mines which lead underground, numbers one, two and three. Try the westernmost mine, number three... mayhap you will find a little less danger there.

Somewhere in the northwestern part of that catacomb there used to be a sweat box for offending miners. A traditional place of confinement, he-he. That is where I started my career, as head of the guards of that prison. Oh, young man! I was as naive as you are now, and I believed in justice... although you cannot possibly understand all this, or me, yet!
