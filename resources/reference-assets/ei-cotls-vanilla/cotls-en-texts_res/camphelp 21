Rune (modifier)
This section holds the rune which modifies the spell. You can add as many runes as you like to the spells you make, as long as the final spell can be used by one of your heroes (i.e. it may not exceed the permitted complexity and amount of energy). Your ability to use runes is determined by the keystone used.
