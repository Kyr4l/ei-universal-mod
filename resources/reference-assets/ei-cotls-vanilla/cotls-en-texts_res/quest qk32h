Emperor's seal
To win the trust of the fugitives, you must get the golden Seal of the Emperor and give it to Brother Khatul. Ordinary Khadaganians are forbidden to touch, take or lend it, under penalty of horrible death. You know that a messenger who wished to deliver the seal was killed? And by a Cyclops who lives in the desert of the Necromancer!
