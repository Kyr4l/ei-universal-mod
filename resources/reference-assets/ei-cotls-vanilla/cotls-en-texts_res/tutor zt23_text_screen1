     Characters can't swim, but they can ford through shallow waters or swamps. The water cannot be deeper than the character's height or he will drown. This means a human can ford through deeper rivers than a wolf, and a Troll can cross even deeper waters than a human.

     Example: your character reaches a river. To continue with the quest you need to get him to a place on the other river bank. Don't worry - he'll  find a way there by himself and ford through the river.

     Note: while a character is in the water he/she won't change position in any way that would make his/her head go under. The character will simply refuse to comply with any such command.
