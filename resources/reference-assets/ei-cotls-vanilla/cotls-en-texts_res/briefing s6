You will not like my words, but I must tell you that you have erred greatly, Chosen! Do you not see that you have played into the Craftsman's hands? You have intensified the fued between the villagers and the Free Hunters.

Yes, that is what I wanted to talk about. I do not know about the Craftsman, but I saw the Redhead in pleasant conversation with an Orc, saw him with my own eyes!

What? How can that possibly be?! Of course, I must trust the word of the Chosen... But tell me, was it the Craftsman who spoke such?

Yes it was. So what?

You are so naive, Chosen!  You did not discern his true plans. He wanted to use you to get rid of the one witness whom he himself induced to become a traitor. I beg of you, talk to me first if this happens again. Then perhaps you will see things in a different light.
