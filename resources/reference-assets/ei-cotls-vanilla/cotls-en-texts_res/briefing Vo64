Oh, what a pity! I would love a look at that red-skinned young man. Is he very beautiful? I would like to steal such a one, though I usually only steal objects and money!

I have only seen one Joon in my life and that was a girl. She really was the most beautiful person I ever saw!

You are in love with her, and she is not with you? Do not deny it! I will give you good advice: stop your search for the young Joon man. She will be sad for a while but then she will start to look at you. The female heart is fickle and well I know it!

I promised to find him. Promised, you understand?

Hah! Typical man... you give your word with no aforethought, then you think you have to keep it! Women act very differently!

Could we get back to the point, please?

Oh dear, are we not impatient? All right, listen: I visited a house once and it was full of all sorts of things: cracked statuettes, dusty manuscripts, pictures from which you could not make a lot. I thought that loot would bring me good money but the fence would not take it - seems Joon antiques had gone out of fashion!

Excellent! The owner of the collection will be happy to get back at least some of it, and in return he would answer all my questions. Could you give me a couple of those things?

You can have all of them, only I did not bother to bring the stuff here to the Last Shelter. It is all in a hiding place near the City, in the ruins of an old barracks on the river bank.  I would get it myself, but the problem is, they built a new barracks near there and I would not particularly like to meet up with the Guards again. So if you want to use my loot, you must get it here first!

All right. But tell me, how do I find the house where this lover of Joon antiques lives? I want to invite him here for a chat.

Toad's eyes, no! You cannot invite anyone here! Good thing Brother Khatul never heard that - his trust in you would fade very swiftly!

But I do not want to talk to the collector in his home! He could play all kinds of dirty tricks on me...

Why his home? Suggest a secluded place for the meeting. If you do not know any, ask Brother Blacksmith, he meets city merchants and knows all the safe places. If Brother Khatul does not mind, he will tell you everything.

And you cannot miss the house. The collector put two stone figures at the entrance. It must have been a problem just to drag them there!
