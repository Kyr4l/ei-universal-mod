Even good deeds can lead to sad consequences, Brother Blondie. I do not have any regrets about the slavedrivers you killed, but you could have left traces which will bring the Guards to the Last Shelter!

That did not happen and I forgive your insubordination. But please remember in future...consult with me or the other brothers before you embark on any other risky enterprise apart from your personal quest.

I will have a word with Brother Blacksmith and I hope he remembers what I shall tell him - and you too. Our position is too insecure here. I hope you understand me.

Yes, I understand you, but I cannot bypass every guard at a hundred paces! Sooner or later I will have to encounter them, it is inevitable!

You are also right in a way, Brother Blondie. But if you start a fight you must win it and leave no enemies alive to tell the tale. Mayhap you should ask Brother Blind to give you some lessons... I will ask him to train you.
