Well... I wanted to give Babur a nice thrashing but the Elder would not let me. Says now is not the right time. Huh, looks just right to me! The Craftsman's too arrogant... charges so much, no one can afford it!

And that story with the Free Hunters - I do not even want to talk about it. Made such a fuss about nothing! But never mind, the Elder and me will make him pay for everything yet!

Well, that is not my business. Just tell me this... several times I saw... I do not even know how to describe it... something like a little Dragon but very small, like a fly, really. It would fly to me, buzz around and fly away. What is that?

Oh, I do not have much time for those flies - smash, and that is that! Now a fly, now a flake, he-he-he!
