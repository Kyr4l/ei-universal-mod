Get into the Orc camp
The Orc and Goblin camp is located to the west of Middle Mountains. To get there you must cross the bridge over the dry riverbed. One of the entrances to the camp is located immediately after the bridge to the north. This entrance is well guarded so you should try to find a way to get past the guards

Find the stockade
There is a prison in the camp - a set fenced from all four sides with gates on one side.

Find any evidence that Airy was here
The granddaughter of the Witch is not here, mayhap Goblins took her somewhere else. Look for traces of her presence.
