Do you laugh at me? Yes, I can see traces of a strong spell on these shreds. Mayhap that was teleport. But no one could tell you where it was directed! Only Great Magicians could do that - so... if you happen to know a Great Magician... go to him!

This cantankerous old man does not even suspect how right he is! Indeed it is time to go see Tka-Rik. If he cannot even tell me where the young man teleported, then what I shall tell Lu-a-Jalla!

I simply must get back to Gipath whatever it takes and there is only one way to do that - through the Portal... But how? There are guards, and I know next to nothing about using the Portal. Mayhap Brother Khatul could help me, if only with some advice...
