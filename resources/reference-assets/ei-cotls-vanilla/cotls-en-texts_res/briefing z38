So, young rogue, you just had to do it, didn't you? How many times did I tell you to keep away from my granddaughter, and what do you do?!

Huh, what did I do? And what about Airy? I have not seen her since the last time I was here.

Why am I not surprised! She ran away. The girl went completely crazy - I will show the Chosen what I can do, she said, I will find that old Magician! I blinked once and lo! She was gone. And it is all your fault, you have turned her head all the way around, you have!

I swear I never even thought about that! She is a nice girl of course but I never paid any special attention to her...
#DESC (amazed, very sincerely)

That is the point. All she thought about was how to make you notice her. I feel that she is in trouble, I feel it in my bones. And I also had a bad dream about the Middle Mountains: there was a Goblin settlement on a hill and a stockade in the middle of it. And they had my girl!

Listen, Chosen, do an old woman a favor and find my granddaughter! At least find out that it was really a dream and no vision. It is not difficult to find that settlement. Just cross the dry riverbed by the bridge, and you will be there. But remember, Goblins and Orcs are all around there, so do not look for trouble!
