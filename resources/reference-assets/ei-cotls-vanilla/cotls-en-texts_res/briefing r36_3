Joons... these proud and beautiful people with reddish skins were masters of this world in ancient times. The ruins of colossal buildings and dusty statues so plentiful here in Gipath are but puny traces of their former glory. I, a Joon Magician, who lived on after my fellow Joons perished, could also be called a remnant of that bygone world.

You called me powerful... Hmm... One should not tempt Great Forces with such talk: there is always something compared to which any power is no more awesome than a moth compared to a Dragon. My powers did not save our race from extinction, nor this world from catastrophe.

Why did I decide that I can ask you, a simple mortal, for help? The answer is easy.

You are brave because you disregarded danger. You are strong because you managed to defeat many enemies. And you are lucky because without luck all the bravery and force in the world are worth nothing. Now listen!

For many centuries I thought I was the last Joon in the world. I did not live, I simply passed the remaining time of my existence. But very recently I felt the presence of other Joons: a young man and a girl, both full of life! And so it was revealed what my mission in life was to be...I was to guard Gipath, ready for that moment when the Joon race will be resurrected here!

Alas, the young people are within my perception but outside of the limits of my power. So that is why I need an assistant...to bring them here. A strong, brave and lucky assistant. I have sought a suitable emissary for a long time - and now I have found you.

So prepare yourself for a journey, my friend: you will have to go to Ingos which now belongs to a state called the Canian Empire. There you must find the girl of my race and bring her to Gipath. And you will know everything else in due time!
