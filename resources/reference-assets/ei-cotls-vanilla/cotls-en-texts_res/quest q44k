Taking skins to meeting place
The hunter wishes to sell his trophies directly to the buyer from the capital, thus cutting out the local merchant. The toadies of the merchant will try to prevent anyone from reaching the tent of the buyer.

Find the meeting place
After you leave the city suburbs and reach Karansul's domain, go south until you reach a hill. Then go east along the hillside until your reach the first valley to the south. That's the meeting place with the buyer. The entrance to the valley and the meeting place are guarded by Karansul's people who do not waste time before attacking anyone entering the valley or even approaching it.

Hang the skins
The skins belonging to the Trapper must be hung on forks near the fire. The buyer will take them later, when he is free to come here.
