Hey, where is the Elder? I did not say he could be moved!

Sorry Chosen... it is my fault, I was not vigilant enough... The Elder actually managed to escape.
#DESC Guiltily, timidly, expecting punishment

What? Is that a joke?
#DESC Amazed, cannot believe it

No, I would not joke about that. Who would have thought he was capable of that? But there is no point in making excuses. My fault. Punish me as you see fit.
#DESC Very upset, and not so much because of the expected punishment but because he failed

What difference does it make whether I punish you or not... actually, all is not lost: the Elder may have escaped from the village but he cannot leave Gipath! One way or another he will get his just desserts.
#DESC Upset but trying to console himself
