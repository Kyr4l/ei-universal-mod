Listen Gort, remember you gave me the Cave Orcs' mechanism? You would not have another one like that but made by the Island Orcs, would you?

What are you going to do with them? Salt for the winter, eh? He-he-he, that was a good one, was it not?

Yes, very funny. But do you have it or not?

Well, there was a story about that one... Free Hunters stole a coffer from the Island Orcs, and there was a thing like that in among the rest of the stuff. So they loaded the loot on a cart and started to pull it but then they quarrelled about something. Word for word, you know, and in the end only one of them came back, and the other just lay there next to the cart.

Yes, I can see they are very nice men, very friendly. So where did you say that coffer was?

In the Middle Mountains, not far from the road...  The Hunter who won the fight took everything with him, but not the mechanism - who would need that junk anyway?!

He is a strange fellow. Always on the lookout for some stupid pieces, and... oh, so maybe he is not the Chosen after all! Never mind what the Elder says!
