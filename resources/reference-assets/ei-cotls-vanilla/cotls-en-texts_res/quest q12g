Golden Valley
Between the hills near the river lie the remains of a caravan which bore gold. The villagers call this place the Golden Valley, but they utter this beautiful name with superstitious fear. The remains are guarded by cohorts of merciless ghouls who are very difficult to deal with.

Find the perished caravan
Golden Valley is located in the middle point of the river, on the eastern shore. The remains of the caravan lie there, very close to the water. Two passages lead to the valley, and there may be an ambush waiting in any of them. Remember that ghouls cannot see but can detect the presence of any live being near them, so you can't get close to them from the back without them noticing.

Take the gold
The gold is in two coffers. One is relatively easy to open, the other is a problem: to open it, your "Use/Steal" skill level must be high enough. One sack of gold would be sufficient to complete the quest, but if you can steal both, why not? Luck be with you!

Escape from the guards of the caravan
The person who actually steals the gold will anger the ghouls who guard Golden Valley. These dead caravan guards will rush to the bank of the river to kill the thief.
