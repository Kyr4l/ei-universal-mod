Here you go, one Dragon amulet. What do I do with it now?

Airy, you started this whole business, so you will have to face the music now. Come on, tell us what it is all about, I do not have much time!

It is all very simple! If you come close to the green Dragon who lives across the lake and you are carrying this amulet, the Dragon will follow you peacefully, wherever you go. Get the amulet and the rest will be easy.
#DESC Happy that she can help

Lead the Dragon to the observatory, and if he sees Harpies he will attack them and clear the way for you!

Stop stop right there!  What an old fool I am! I almost sent the lad to a certain death! Nor did you remind me!

I mean the Lizards who live in the Middle Mountains near the passage to the lake!

But they are peaceful!

They used to be peaceful, but not any more! If they catch sight of the Chosen, we can forget him! Even I am not sure what to do about them... although there might be one way...

Why not have a word with Babur, Chosen? He goes to the Remote Mountains to get his stones and the Lizards never attacked him. But do not even think about going to the Middle Mountains until you have found out how to pacify these Lizards!

I see... so on top of everything else, I also have to make peace with some damned Lizards! How tiresome all this is! But thanks anyway for your advice, Estera, and thank you for your information, Airy. You are really a most capable little lady!

There he goes again! "Little!" When will people realise I am not a little girl?! Will I never prove to the Chosen that I deserve better than a few kind words? But I shall never give up!
