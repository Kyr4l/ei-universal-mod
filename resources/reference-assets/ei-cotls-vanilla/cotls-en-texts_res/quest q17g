Green Crystals are necessary for the "Ice Spell". You will find these crystals deep in a ravine, in the mountains where the Dead City is located. Look to the north of the city gates.

Cheat the Troll
There is a Troll who lives next to the entrance to the ravine. He is not easy to kill, but you could first lure him away, then slip into the ravine where the huge Troll cannot follow.

Find the Crystal deposit
A deposit of Crystals is located at the farthest end of the ravine. Be careful when you move down the ravine: there may be other enemies there, apart from the Troll!
