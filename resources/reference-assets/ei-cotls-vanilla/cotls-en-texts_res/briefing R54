In our people's legends, fortune has always been presented as a wild horse which gallops wildly and has no mane to hold on to. Not everyone can  mount it, and fewer still can stay on it for very long. In Ingos you held fortune in your hands very tightly - so do not let it slip in Suslanger! There are a lot of people there who would love to see you thrown off into the dirt...

There were enough of those in Ingos too. Diera alone was a prime example!

Do not remind me of her! That woman!  I do not know words bad enough to describe that creature. Diera imagined me to be her rival for the affections of the Governor!

How I tried to convince her I do not care about anyone but At-Zako - she never listened, not once. I still shiver when I think about those catacombs where she held me prisoner! What a good thing At-Zako will never experience that dreadful damp and cold!

My knowledge of other lands is poor but what I do know of Suslanger is that it is neither cold nor damp. But I cannot guarantee that the climate will make our sojourn there very pleasant.
