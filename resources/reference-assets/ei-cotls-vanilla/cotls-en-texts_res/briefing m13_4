Why did you not tell me that you had found a letter?
#ANIMATION 3
#CAMERA 10
#phrase Hero  2
How do you know about it?

#phrase Smith  3
A wee bird told me. That stupid Captain came and mocked me, he says "you're gonna get it lad". Apparently the Elder read that I was plotting against you.

That is true. Here is the letter, and I would like you to explain it!

Explain what? I do not know what it really says. I am not very good with letters anyway, never mind the Orc ones. Why do you not show it to the Witch and listen to how she reads it?
