Ah, the storyteller... What do you want now? Not to tell me another one?

I know you have big commercial interests here, so you must know everything about these parts!

Well, I believe so... and?

There are closed mines here, though the area is rich. Why are half of the mines idle?

They work the mines underground, where all sorts of creatures live. Miners stumble on a nest of ghouls and all your human and material investments vanish. So the Governor issued a decree to put the mines under lock and key... Wait! Do you wish to work them?

Perchance, perchance. But I will have to find a way to get the Governor's permission. Maybe you could help - I told you such a good tale that we are close friends now, are we not?

Friends like you lie in the woods with their bellies cut open, you will see! But all right, boy, I will play out this hand too...

Why not give the Governor something "exquisite, precious and stylish", or just something expensive. Like an old gold nugget. He will immediately become interested in the mines and give you permission to start working there, believe me. And you do not even have to go underground for that!

In the land of abandoned mines, to the southeast, there is another pit, also closed, because the workers were lazy and they quit. One of them told me that he hid a golden nugget in the southernmost part of the pit.

Those lazy workers told one hell of a tale, so the Governor ordered the area sealed off. But we are friends, so I will give you the key to the gates. And they are easy to find. Enter the land of the abandoned mines, go east, bypass the military camp from the north, and you are almost there.

Go, go, find the nugget! Just the thing for you, because there are definitely not enough bones in those pits yet... storyteller, ha-ha-ha!
