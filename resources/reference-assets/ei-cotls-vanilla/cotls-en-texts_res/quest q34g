Returning water to Lizards
The Orcs built a dam to cut off the spring and rerouted it to their territory. You must lift the dam and block the canal.

The dam
To find the dam go south along the eastern bank of the river which starts near Hermit is home. The dam is located a short distance down the stream after the place where a small spring joins the river (on the eastern side).

Raise the dam
To enable the water to flow down the river, you must raise the dam using the Lizard's lever.

Find the stone
A large stone which the Orcs could not move very far away overhangs the canal. It is located a short distance upstream after the dam. A push, the stone falls, the canal is blocked!

Push the stone into the canal
The Orcs did not move the stone very far from the edge of the canal, but left it where even a single man could push it down.
