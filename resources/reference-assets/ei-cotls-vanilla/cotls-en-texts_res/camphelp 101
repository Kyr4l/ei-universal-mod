Spells shop
The scrollable lists at the top and bottom parts of the screen show what spells are available both in the shop and in your inventory. Use the buttons on the left and right sides of the lists to sort the items. The "shop counter" is located in the middle of the screen. In the lower left part of the screen, you can see the total cost of transaction. Use the adjacent buttons to confirm or cancel transaction (if you cancel, all runes will be returned).
