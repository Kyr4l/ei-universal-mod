You wanted to tell me about the Woodsfolk and asked me to remind you. Well, tell me!

Oh yes, that's right! Woodsfolk are more or less "Children of Nature", you know. They do not build houses, do not work the fields and of course they have no towns at all. But they are far from stupid, it is just that their minds work differently from ours.

And of course because of that humans do not understand them and... either do not like them or... are afraid of them. Look at our Captain of the Guards: he is so brave... he always promises to deal with those Woodsfolk once and for all. Why do you think he does that? Because he is afraid, that is why...

But one should not be afraid of them! On the contrary, we could learn from them: for example, can any human tame a unicorn? No! And Woodsfolk do it all the time, as if it were second nature to them. And they know the woods better than I do, even though I have been a hunter since I was a kid!

Actually, they are not really interested in humans. But if someone angers them, his prospects will indeed be grim. Woodsfolk may be small but they are hard to fight. They have a special weapon: a tube out of which they blow little poisoned arrows, just like the one which skewered the snoop.

What harm can that little funny thing do? It will not even penetrate even a leather breastplate, will it?

Even if it was a mithrill one! There is a chink in every armor and the Woodsfolk will hit it all right, never fear.

Then there are the tame unicorns. Those beasts are beautiful but if they get angry you will wish you had never seen that particular kind of beauty before! And there is one thing more... Woodsfolk know magic.

So that is the kind of little fellows we have around here. If you get on the wrong side of them, expect trouble, but if you manage to make friends with them, value it. A friendship like that could be very useful!
