I am Sver's friend - people call him Trapper - and he advised me to talk to you. He says you know a secret which enables one to... err... act quietly and without fuss when circumstances demand it.

Ha! You do have a swift tongue, young man, though the same cannot be said about your hands. Do not take offense: a professional of my skills can see right away that your hands are not too swift.

Frankly, yes. He said you could train me.

The old fox! A while ago Trapper did me a very big favor and he knows I cannot refuse him now!
