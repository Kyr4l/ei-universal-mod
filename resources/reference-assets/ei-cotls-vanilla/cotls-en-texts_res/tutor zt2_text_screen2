     You cannot zoom too far in or out, nor can you set the camera exactly horizontal or vertical. You can, however, get a very detailed view of something by pressing and holding down the <PgUp> key. This will let you zoom in further. When you release the key the camera will automatically return to the usual Maximum zoom value.
