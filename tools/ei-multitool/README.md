# EI Multitool
### Developed by Kyr4l

## How to use
This is a special tool i made to automate compilation of the EI assets, they use WINE and some basic commands available on Linux
I don't plan to port this tool to Windows as I do not use it (and I hate batch)

To use it, open a bash terminal in this directy, and run `bash makemod.sh`
