What are those strange rumors circulating in the village? People are talking about some Ogre who learned how to change into a toad...

Well, I never! You can not tell anything to anybody without them twisting it all around! Of course nobody has changed into anything; just the Orcs breeding another Ogre toad ...

The Seers make potage from some herbs, pour those over an ordinary poisonous toad and it grows huge! Every time the Orcs make themselves another ally like that, we search for brave men who are willing to go and deal with the toad.

By the way, now that you know all about it, why not you have a try? You may find the toad in the north-east of the Foothills!
