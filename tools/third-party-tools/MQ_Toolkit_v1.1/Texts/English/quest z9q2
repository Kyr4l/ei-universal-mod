Undead
A Necromancer who once arrived on Gipath with a Khadaganian expedition has been dead for a very long time now but his magic is still alive.  Undead creatures prowl around the site of the old Khadaganian camp. They are much more dangerous than skeletons and can spread all around Gipath if you do not destroy them promptly..
