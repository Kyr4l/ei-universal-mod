Lizards in the trap
The Orcs have caught a number of young Forest Lizards in a trap. Hermit Lizard has asked humans to set them free and in return has promised to convince his tribe not to attack the humans. The location where the Lizards are trapped is to the west of the northern river bank, where the Goblin settlement used to be.
