It looks like our village will never get rid of those Brigand neighbors! Whatever plans I make are good for nothing. We can never destroy them completely! But now I have an excellent new idea…

Hmmm... Actually, when I hear the words "an excellent new idea" I always expect a catch!
#phrase Nsheriff  3
Ah there is no catch! I merely want you to take the loot away from the Brigands. You need not even fight them. The main thing is to get the sack they keep in their camp.

Of course, the approaches to the camp are well guarded, but you could cheat the guards...
