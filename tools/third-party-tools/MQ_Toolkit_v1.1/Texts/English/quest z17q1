Finding the messenger's remains
The messenger was supposed to approach the Last Shelter's entrance from the south. Try looking for his dead body somewhere there.

Judging by the body, the messenger was killed either by banshees or by spiders. Neither of these creatures search dead bodies, so the document should be there!
