#phrase Rick  1
The army which shall invade Gipath includes not just humans, but also zombies and ghouls, and the most dangerous undeads of all -  the shadows.
#phrase Rick  2
The sorcerer who can summon those from nonexistence lives in the city of Suslanger; if he is killed, the invasion army shall be weakened.
#phrase Hero  3
Hmm... If that sorcerer were anywhere near the portal I could try getting him. But if I have to go all the way from the portal to the city, I will simply be killed!
#phrase Rick  4
Of course I shall not send you there through the portal! You will be teleported directly to Suslanger. All you must do is enter the city and find the gates displaying two sculptures of eagles at its sides. That is the mansion belonging to the Master of Shadows - he is the one you must kill!
