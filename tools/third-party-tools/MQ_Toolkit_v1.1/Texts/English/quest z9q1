The Dead City and its treasures
The Dead City still has a lot of treasures, dating back to the time when people lived there. But there is a rumor that the city is ruled by an old Dragon who will not let anyone touch those treasures. Is there any truth in this, or is it fantasy?

Does the Dragon exist?
The villagers say that the Chosen conversed with an old Dragon who lives on the top of Lone Mountain. If this dragon really exists, you should not touch the treasure.

Finding the crypt
The crypt with the treasure is in the eastern part of the Dead City ravine, in the cemetery. Since there was no Dragon on Lone Mountain, you can safely take it.
