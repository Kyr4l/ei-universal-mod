Pity we do not have the Chosen with us! He would make a deal with the Orcs, but now they are going to attack our village!
#phrase Nsheriff  2
They took the old Goblin settlement in the Middle Mountains and recently elected themselves a new Seer who is going to lead them in their expeditions! I do not know what we are going to do ...
#phrase Hero  3
Is it so difficult? Just send a couple of capable guys and cut that Seer's throat for him... It will take the Orcs a while to elect another one!
#phrase Nsheriff  4
Do you think this did not occur to me? But it is very difficult to get into their village, and the Seer is sure to be well protected! I can not send people to a certain death, and so far nobody has volunteered...
#phrase Hero  5
Well, yes they did. I shall do it.
