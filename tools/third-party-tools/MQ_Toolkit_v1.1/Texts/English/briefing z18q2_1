Have you ever heard of Aiset-Bek?
#phrase Hero  2
Of course I have! Even the guards speak about him in a whisper...
#phrase Glav  3
Ahh... I should have a good talk with you: I wonder how you come to be so well informed about the habits of the guards ...
#phrase Hero  4
Do you suspect me of something, Brother Khatul?
#phrase Glav  5
Oh no, no suspicions at all! I trust you as I trust myself, and to prove that I would like to ask you to execute the death sentence passed on Aiset-Bek a long time ago.

At this moment, he is  inspecting a garrison near the southern bridge at the western river bank; it is a good chance to make Aiset-Bek pay for everything!
#phrase Glav  7
I am sure you would be happy to kill that blood-thirsty spider! But if you refuse, I must say I might really start getting suspicious ...
