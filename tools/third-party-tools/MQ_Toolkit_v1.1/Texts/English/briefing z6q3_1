Why are you so unhappy? If you have any problem, just tell me - perhaps I can help!

I am definitely not happy... The Lizards living in the north of the Middle Mountains stole piggy Fivepence! I remember how the Chosen used to kick him, for no reason, really, and Fivepence did not like that at all! Ah, he is so clever and sweet, you see... And now he is no longer!

Wait, wait... What little piggy? I remember Fivepence - that is one huge pig!

Well, he is still a tiny sweet little thing to us... But what is the point of talking about it! The Lizard took him away, in the ravines near the lake, and I fear that was the last we shall see of him!

OK, do not worry. Mayhap you shall see your precious little animal yet!
