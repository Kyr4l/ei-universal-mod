Mayhap you heard that I collect exotic weapons and other rarities?
#phrase Hero  2
Of course, Your Excellency. Everybody knows about your wonderful collection!
#phrase Huber  3
Good, good ... And do you know that people who are called "Your Excellency" should occasionally receive some nice gifts? Mayhap you did not know that, but now I have enlightened you, so to speak, yes?

Mmm... I think I know what you mean!
#phrase Hero  5
Mmmm... Your Excellency!  I would like to make you a present; could you tell me what would be especially please you?
#phrase Huber  6
Of course I could! I would like to have that gold nugget which decorates the neck of the Royal Deer. The beast is very easy to find - he grazes in the wide valley north of the river, with the rest of his herd.

But please be careful. The Royal Deer, unlike common deer, can defend himself, so if you die, my collection will not gain a new exhibit! That would be very, very sad, don't you think?
