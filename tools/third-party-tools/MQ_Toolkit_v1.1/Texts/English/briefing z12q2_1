What effrontery! That miserable thief Baldie dared to rob my house again!!! Those brigands know that my loyal captain Tilvar is no longer with us, so they do troll only knows what! What a shame I never ordered him to crush that brigands' nest on the western lake shore when I had a chance ...

So here we are now, such are the fruits of my leniency: the key from the governor's arsenal is missing, and if we do not get it back, the brigands will have the most modern weapons!

What? Do you mean you have something there which can not be bought from Karansul?
#phrase Huber  4
If only I knew! Frankly, I never bothered to have a look in that arsenal, it was captain Tilvar's responsibility ...

But anyway, we must have that key back!
