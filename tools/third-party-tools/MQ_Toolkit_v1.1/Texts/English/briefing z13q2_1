Your Excellency, you look worried. What has happened?
#phrase Huber  2
Do not even ask, you know very well what happened! Woodsfolk of the Black Clan learned to breed black unicorns, and everybody knew about it - every one that is, except me, until today!
#phrase Hero  3
And what is wrong with that?
#phrase Huber  4
A fully grown black unicorn is much stronger and more vicious than an ordinary one! Neither a warrior nor a commoner would be able to go through woods infested with them!
#phrase Huber  5
But those horrible creatures are still young, they are not that strong, so I ask you to try and kill them all before it is too late!
