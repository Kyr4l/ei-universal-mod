We have a chance to improve our relations with lizards, and I hope you'll play the main role in that one!

So must I repeat the Chosen's expedition after the Big Shell?

No, no, it is not about that. Recently the Hermit Lizard came to the village and asked to free his people from the trap.

The young and silly Lizards went to the Orc land west of the northern river bank and got themselves thrown in prison. Hermit promised that if the Lizards were set free, he would forbid the tribe to bother humans for a whole month!
