I often remember brother Blondie who left us in as strange a way as he joined us. That young man had a common enough appearance, but he was very clever and cunning. Even now, when Blondie is no longer with us, his deeds live in our memories.
#phrase Glav  2
For example, recently I received a communication from the disgraced Necromancer Kholai with whom Blondie had some sort of very mysterious business. But this time the interests of Kholai are very simple, and similar to our own.
#phrase Glav  3
Kholai's enemy, the young magician Taivo, managed to use the body of a dead Necromancer and made a zombie magician out of it. This creature never sleeps or rests, is stronger than an ordinary zombie, and it also uses combat magic!
#phrase Glav  4
Kholai wants to teach us how to kill such enemies quickly and safely - he thinks that would be a blow to Taivo's authority. However, to achieve that Kholai needs the head of the zombie magician head.

Are you going to order me to get it?
#phrase Glav  6
Oh no! We all are brothers here, no one orders anyone else around. Everything is done on purely voluntary basis, because people understand the need for action!
#phrase Glav  7
So when you realize it has to be done, keep in mind that the zombie magician is now in the Necromancers' city.
#phrase Glav  8
And old Kholai's tower is located north of the town. But please be careful! The disgraced Necromancer's home is guarded as heavily as the town itself!
