If only you knew, Rivar, how fed up I am with those Will-o'-the-wisps! My burns are healing, but every time I must pay to repair my armor, and frankly, it does not come cheap!

Well, in that case you must find the Queen of the Will-o'-the-wisps - the one who breeds them. If you kill her, there will be far fewer of these creatures for a while.

Try looking for the Queen in the mountain ravine north of the main gates to Dead City. There is a crystal site there, and the Queen lives somewhere near it. Good luck!
