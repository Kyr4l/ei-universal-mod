#phrase Hero  1
Everybody knows the legend about the Chosen conversing with the dragon in Dead City, just as they know of the sword he brought back - a magical one and made of iron to boot!
#phrase Hero  2
What do you think Rivar, what is real here and what is our imagination?
#phrase Nsheriff  3
Frankly, I do not know. I saw the sword with my own eyes, but I never met the dragon. Maybe it was a tale. Are you going to try venturing into Dead City?
#phrase Hero  4
Well... Actually, yes. They say there is a crypt in the old cemetery and one could find something valuable there.
#phrase Nsheriff  5
It is up to you. I will not try to discourage you, but I will tell you this: before you go into the crypt, climb up the Lone Mountain. Who knows, perchance there really is an old dragon up there? And perchance he will not like it if you start prowling around his domain without even saying hello first?
#phrase Nsheriff  6
In a word, just be careful, OK?
