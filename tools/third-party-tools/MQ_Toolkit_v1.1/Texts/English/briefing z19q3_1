#phrase Rick  1
I received very worrying news from Suslanger! General Iriskell will begin moving his troops to Gipath any day now.
#phrase Rick  2
The only way to avoid trouble is to shut down the Suslanger portal. To achieve that, you must get near it, find General Iriskell and take the portal key from him.
#phrase Rick  3
Then switch both magic obelisks near the portal entrance, and the way to Gipath will be closed to anyone except those I transfer personally.
#phrase Rick  4
Keep in mind that General Iriskell earned his rank not so much by his military talents as by his ferocity, cruelty and great strength. You will need all your caution, cunning and skills ... and most importantly - your luck!
