The Great Exit
Although Esther doesn't want help, she must be escorted at least through Dead City territory.

Approach the courtyard
Old age is no match for Esther - she wants to exit through the main gates with a bang, even though they're the most heavily protected.
#subobj 2
Wait for Esther to cast her spell
Esther has prepared a surprise. You need to protect her for a while.
#subobj 3
Kill the rest of the undead
Now all that's left to do is kill what's left of the skeletons that Esther treated with her spell, and you can move on.
#subobj 4
Leave the area
The witch must be escorted to the edge of the area, she will walk the rest of the way on her own.
#subobj 5
Esther must survive
Without the witch, the search for the Magic Bullet is doomed to failure.
