Well, thank you sweetie, you didn't give the grandmother a forfeit in the Dead City. If it wasn't for that flower I never would have gone to the dragon!

Well, where? The flower is called the Dragon Flower - you said yourself that it's an extraordinary flower, and all signs pointed to it blooming somewhere recently. And who but the Dragon could tell me where to look for it!

So I went to this old feller, and he said - he didn't agree to say anything! If you hadn't shown up, I don't know how this case would have ended. So thank you boy, you bailed me out, and I won't be left with a debt!
