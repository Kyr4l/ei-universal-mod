Spell constructor
With the help of prototypes and runes from your inventory (and those from the store) you can create new spells. You can do this in two ways. Either by using the appropriate prototypes and (optionally) runes, or by disassembling the spells you have. The price details of the operation can be found at the bottom of the left window. The buttons next to the window are used to confirm/cancel operations.
