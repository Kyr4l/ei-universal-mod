You! You're Joon! Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life! How I searched for so long for other Joons in this world, and I met a real magician! I am Kir-Achit-La, and I am also a Joon.

Yes, I too have waited a long time for you, Kir. That's what your companion calls you, right? You can call me Tka-Rick. I am the Great Mage of Gipath. Unfortunately I am chained to this earth and could not help you on Suslanger.

And on Gipath you reached me earlier than I had time to come to you for help in your search. With that you proved that you are a Joon not only in appearance but in spirit.

I am happy to see you here no less than you are to see me. For too long I have lived here in solitude, nurturing the hope that someday a better time will come, and the ancient Joon race will once again be reborn and regain its power.

That time has come. That Joon you followed from Suslanger to Gipath turned out to be not the only one in the world. There is also a girl, the beautiful Lu-a-Jalla. Now these two youngsters are the sprouts of a resurgent race, and they travel the world gaining experience and skill.

Great Tka-Rick, I need to learn so many things! I have lived so long in ignorance about this! But yet I don't have time for long lectures either.

You're right, you got tired of the road. Get some rest first and then tell me your story.
