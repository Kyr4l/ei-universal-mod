Ah, my dears have arrived! To punish you forbids me honor. For how can one punish heroes of whom the whole countryside speaks? After all, everyone only speaks of you as saviors who have come to help defeat Khadagan evil on Jygran!

I assure your Baron that we were driven only by a desire to free your land from the magic of Yamanin. We don't want to take away the glory of your victory over Firez for anything.

And what are you talking about? Where's the glory... We sit after strongholds, our noses afraid to put forward. This is not how our ancestors warred! We should not hide and fear every breath of those vile khadagans.

But enough about that. I am now developing a plan for an offensive operation. Soon the ground will start shaking under the feet of the enemies fleeing from us!!!
