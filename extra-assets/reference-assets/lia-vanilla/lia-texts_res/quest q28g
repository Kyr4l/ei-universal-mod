The way through the tunnel
There is no doubt that the tunnel leads to the dwelling of the Great Magician of these lands, but it is well known that this passage is protected by merciless and fearless mechanical murderers - golems. The way will be unsafe, but the risk is justified!

Make your way through the cave
The golems have closed all the tunnels, but a breach has appeared in one of the walls with a passage to the cave, probably as a result of the earthquake. You can try to bypass the tunnel with the cave.

Find the switch
Judging by everything, golems are operated and controlled in this room. There is definitely something in the chamber to the south that can help with this.

Use the obelisk
In the southern part of the large room protected by golems, there is an obelisk that will help you gain partial control of the golems.

Use the altar
The Golems protecting the Altar in the southeast have been given a new command. This is a great opportunity to get to the altar and use the key to gain full control over the golems!

Leave the tunnel
Now the golems are no longer dangerous. The way is clear!
