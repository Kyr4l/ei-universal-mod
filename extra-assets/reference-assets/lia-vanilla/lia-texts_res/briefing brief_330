Tweirdza has been taken over. But I didn't doubt it. We worked a lot, made sure the gates were left unguarded.

I don't doubt it. It's just that he will only appropriate the victory one way or another. History is usually silent about spies and the outstanding work they do. But I'm not chasing fame.

Something else is important to me: a quiet corner, a house with a garden, a beloved wife and a pack of kids. I would love to prepare dumplings and cookies for them.

Don't even tell me... But I've already picked out a place to call home. There is a beautiful valley between two rivers - the mountains cover it from the north, the river from the south. It is peaceful and nice there. And only one drawback: too dangerous neighbors live there. Harpies, wild animals... and it still smells of mystery!
