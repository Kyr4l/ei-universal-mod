Well, let's just say I got there just in time. Sahilla wouldn't have survived out there on her own for long. Glad I helped save another pretty girl's life.

Silence Sahilla, you are too weak yet. For the time being you need help. Kir, how about helping us again? You can find healing herbs at necromancers, in the desert they have a composition.

Not another word! Once I've helped Sahilla avoid death, I'll help get her back on her feet too. While Sahilla is resting, I will get the herbs.
