Oh Kiel, you're just in time. My collection has just been enriched by a great copy. Come on, let me show you.

Rindeil, maybe a little later. I get so tired, and you still want me after this run.... aa- yes, how are your beetles doing?

Spiders, Kiel, spiders! How many times do I have to say it! But wait girl, what escape are you talking about? What happened?

Well, as if to tell you... anyway, if it wasn't for that boy's help, I'd be working in some shithole for the rest of my life.

Oh my good Rindeil, don't take it so personally. After all, it's over! Now get acquainted with my new colleague, which is called Kir. And imagine that he has become acquainted with the treaty of the Great Zufie... Zielifu, Ziefajfus or whatever they call him, I don't remember. But you know who it's about...

Oh, my boy! You know the treatises of the Great Ziefius! Welcome to my mansion! I'm always happy to welcome new guests, and even more so those who share my passions! I am Rindeil, the host of this estate, as well as the owner of the largest collection of spiders in Khadagan. And now you tell us about yourself.

Thank you very much for such hospitality, dear Rindeil. I don't have much to tell about myself, my whole life is subordinated to one goal - to free the people close to me and to deal with Firiez. He tricked my family into slavery and made them work for it. And they are scholars, like you, Rindeil. Firiez uses their knowledge for an evil purpose...

A sad story, no doubt about it. I will do what I can to help you. Science is the future of the world but in the hands of fools and scoundrels it will only bring misery.... I'll be glad to help you.
