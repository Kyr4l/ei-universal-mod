We did a nice job. Now life here will be a lot more peaceful. We should have taken Dartas with us! I'm sure he was bored to death sitting in the fortress non-stop.

Don't remind me of him! It's better for him to die in the womb!

So far, nothing yet. But it will happen if he looks in my direction again. No one has ever insulted me like that before!

Calm down, Kiel. Tell me everything one by one. Did he insult you?

Insulted me? He insulted you? Ha! You forgot who you were dealing with. He didn't insult me, he insulted my feelings! I didn't chop him up on the spot just because he knocked me off track with his insolence.

Look, you really don't want me to remember all this and tell you the crap I heard from that bug! And I don't need your pity!

It's okay, Kiel, don't worry. Whatever he tells you in there, he'll regret his words. I'll take care of it.
