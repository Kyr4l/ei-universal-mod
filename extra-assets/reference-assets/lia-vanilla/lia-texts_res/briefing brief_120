Are you the boy who saved our children from the lizards in Distant Peaks? Dobrak sent me. Our ataman said he would be glad to see you at our camp and thank you in person.

You will easily find your way to our camp, it is located in the north of the Foothills. Just be careful when passing by the New Village. The people there are too suspicious - they shoot first and then ask who's coming!

And also: if our goblin guards don't want to let you through the watchtower, then you can not deal with them, then we will hire new ones. Well, we look forward to your visit!
