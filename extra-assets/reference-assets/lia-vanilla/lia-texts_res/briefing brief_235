Did you hear the news? Brissen's been shot! He lived to see it, the 'Good Knight', defender of the oppressed. HA!

Something doesn't even try to show sadness.

Why should I be sad? He was just asking to get tapped! It's a wonder this hasn't happened before. And his friend is no worse! I wonder what it was all about.

I can't believe Jam-Akara killed Brissen.

I don't believe it either, too wimpy for that. Well, but he won't stir underfoot now....

But all is well for you now! And Brissen is gone, and the mage is under lock and key. Didn't you have a hand in this?

What are you talking about, girl? I didn't have a way. You'd better ask Hysa. He hated the old magician more than me, he hated him like a thorn in his throat - he just couldn't live!

And Brissen, too, ever since he set up his lab and started doing experiments on nature.

And just the other day I saw Hys hanging out in the woods with some shady type. Yeah, he was definitely dating some associate of his!

Karansul blames everything on Hys, but his eyes are running back and forth. He is dimming something. Well, what was he doing in the forest by himself then?
