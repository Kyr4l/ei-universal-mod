    There are two different types of areas in the game, Game Zones and Dialog zones.  Game zones are where most of the action happens.  Dialog zones are where quests are typically received.

    Your character can only talk to and transact with other characters in the Dialog zones.  Your characters can only do battle in Game zones.

    To try to initiate a conversation in a Dialog zone, just place the cursor over a character. If the character has something to say, then his/her name will appear next to the cursor, along with a picture of moving lips. If the character has nothing to say at that particular time, only the name will appear - no lips. See the next screen for more on talking to characters in the Dialog zone.

     There are several Dialog zones on the various islands which will become available to you. On each island there is at least one Dialog zone (called "base") which is always available. Here your character can buy, sell and order items or spells. The option "buy, sell, order" will appear on the character who will handle these tasks for you.

     Note: in Gipath you can trade items and spells on different bases.
