Estero, I'm here to tell you that the advice in the book helped. Look, the sphere has become clear again.

Yes, I see. Now you're going back to the Great Magician? Wasn't it scary to go through the tunnel?

What tunnel? I went to his cave through a ravine in Distant Peaks.

Well, you got lucky, boy! But only that time. Now they say there was a landslide in the Distant Peaks. The whole eastern gorge has collapsed.

Why are you so scared right now? Don't be afraid, there's another way, albeit a dangerous one. True - the Chosen One has gone through it, which means you will too. I don't think the golems will scare you... if you find a way to turn them off.

I have no choice but to go through the tunnel.
