Mr. Mage, I found out about your interest in the ice elementals from the mine, and I brought some samples of them.

What extraordinary magical reflections.... yes... yes, yes. That explains a lot. I always assumed that the basis of their magical energy was formed by the finest particles, reflecting all material objects...

Ah, sorry, I got complacent. Let me introduce myself. My name is Jam-Akara, and I am a practicing first degree mage, and a member of the honorable church of mages of the three worlds. I am pleased to be acquainted with a representative of a very ancient race. After all, you are a Joon, if I am not mistaken?

Yes, recently a magic orb showed me that there is an ancient artifact on Ingos, gifted with Joon magic. It is extremely important to me to find it and save my family. But my meager abilities are not enough to bring it to light. And I would like to ask for your help in the search.

A Joon artifact! What an interesting case! Yes, I will dutifully help you. This will allow me to gather enough material to speak at the next church meeting with a paper.
