Kir, let's ask this bearded man about magicians. He's a trader and should know everything.

Good morning, sir! Couldn't you help us with something? We're looking for a magician.

And here what, it says where that I give information? I am a Karansul trader and I run a store not a message board!

How about being more polite, trader? We may become your customers. And we may or may not become one! Depends on how you behave.

We need a magician, and we have business with him. We want to ask him for help.

Ah well, if you're looking for help then you need that abnormal one who's been hanging around with Brissen. I wonder which lich brought him to us here!

How would I know? It would be better for me if it was deep in the ground! He's ruined my whole trade! He's giving away the right runes for free! Who's gonna buy from me?!

Wait a minute. You said if we need help, we need this magician. Does that mean there's another one?

Oh, yes! There's a Hys serving at Governor Valrasian's. He's set up a lab for himself, sits there now and doesn't come out. But that's nothing, he'll still be up in the air someday. Believe me!

Well, it's all clear now. All right, let's go Kir.
