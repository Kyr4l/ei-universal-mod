Turns out your governor is quite the lover of the uncommon. He asked me to try to get a forest people mage arrow for him. That's just a silly task.

I'm ready to disagree. He'll be more gracious to you after your gift. Ha, boy, that's a rule as old as the world. Valrasian himself sends such gifts to the capital from time to time, and for that they look through their fingers at what is being created here.

Yes, we've heard something about these gifts. These caravans are certainly tasty morsels for the highwaymen.

And what did you think? Last time his highness sent a giant nugget to the capital. I wish I had one, I wouldn't let it out of my hands anymore!

Yes, such things know how to attract attention. But how do you know exactly what the governor is sending in those caravans?

Yes, yes... If Karansul is so clued up, he might have also arranged the theft of the nugget. One should keep an eye on him.
