Well, I... agreed, I'll tell you everything. I found out that Hys is putting all the blame on Karansul. I convinced him to flee the city, and I'm keeping him in my hunting lodge.

And why are you so sure it's not him? After all, he was really driving suspiciously. He kept going somewhere. I'm sure Brissen caught him at something, and he finished the poor guy off. And Hysa, for sure, was following him too. It all comes together!

The reason Karansul couldn't kill Brissen was because at the time he was  with me. I was the one he was hanging out with. He even learned a few protection spells to to keep our meetings safe. After all, people are curious.

We decided to get married. But we were afraid to tell people about it. Everyone here will laugh at me if they find out.

Oh Great Powers!!! And because of such trifles we lost so much time suspecting Karansul! You can let him go, no one will suspect him again.
