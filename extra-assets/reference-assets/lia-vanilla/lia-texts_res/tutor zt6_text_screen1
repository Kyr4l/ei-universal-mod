     You can pick up items (treasure) from your enemy's corpse and use or sell them later.

     To search a dead body simply place the cursor over it, wait for the cursor to change shape and click. A message will appear framed in the Text window describing what you've just picked up.

     Note: Collected items go to your "inventory". You can only manage your inventory in camp or in Shop screens. You can't examine items or change clothes or weapons while your characters are in the Game zone.
