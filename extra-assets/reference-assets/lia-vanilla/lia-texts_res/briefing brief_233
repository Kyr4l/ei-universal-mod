It's just terrible - to think that I could have killed my old friend! The ignorance of the local authorities simply makes me furious!

Mr. Mage, calm down. Emotions won't get you anywhere. We believe in your innocence and want to prove it. But you should help us.

Yes, you are right girl. I can definitely state that I was in the mines all day, and showed up at the crime scene too late to fix anything.

In the morning I left a message for Brissen, writing where and when we would meet to then head together to his forest people friends for a visit. But I came too late.

I learned a long time ago to get around without the little formalities when I really need to. One good soldier lets me through to the mine just like that.
