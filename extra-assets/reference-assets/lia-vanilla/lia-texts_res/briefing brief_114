Man, I came here to offer you a deal.

What kind of deal?

#phrase IZ 3
I found out you were looking for this man who called himself The Chosen One. I know where he could be right now.

Oh, how nice! Kiel always knew not to judge by appearance. You're such a scary dude, and yet you're willing to help us.

Hmm... I've been called all sorts of things, but not once. I must remember. I liked it.

It's cool that you liked it, but tell me what kind of deal you're proposing. Because I understand you're not just gonna tell anything.

You are the default. I want to settle by a lake in the Distant Peaks. The lake lizards are stupid, they don't want me to settle there.

A sad story, but what's in it for us?

I want you to put the Great Shell on a pedestal in the Distant Peaks. I know you have the Shell. I will do that, and I will tell you where to find this man.

He's a strange one, maybe not worth trusting, but I don't have a choice either. The Shell will have to be referenced.

Okay, it's done. I'll take the Shell to the Distant Peaks, and you can tell me where the Chosen One is.
