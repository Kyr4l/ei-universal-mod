Firez! Prepare to die! I've come for your life!

#phrase Firez 2
Oh, let's avoid this chatter. I'm happy to get to know you personally, Kit-A-Chit-Lan. Or should I just call you Kir? My little dragon has followed you since the beginning of your escape. I have watched you with interest.

Who are you? You are Joon! But how is that possible!
#ANIMATION 11

#phrase Firez 4
Are you surprised? And what do you know about me? You're used to hating me without even knowing anything about me.

#phrase Hero 5
It was enough for me that you held the Joons captive. And you're a Joon yourself! How could you decide to do that!

#phrase Firez 6
You fool! I saved them from the Curse of the race. They were safe under my protection.

#phrase Hero 7
You killed my parents. You're the reason they died. I hate you!

#phrase Firez 8
Oh, and how I hate all of you. Joons. They were all wrong to cast me out. They said it was unworthy of a true Joon to engage in necromancy!
#ANIMATION 43

#phrase Firez 9
But it was necromancy that allowed me to save them from the Curse! And they were laughing at me! Necromancy gave me practically eternal life! You fools! How I hate you all!

#phrase Hero 10
You're insane. In order to prolong your life, you lose Jygran. You are a murderer and a villain!
#ANIMATION 62

#phrase Firez 11
Am I a murderer? Are you! How many dead bodies have you left behind in your path? And how many innocents have you killed for the sake of a few coins?
#ANIMATION 32

#phrase Firez 12
And yet you dare call me a villain. Yes! I'm crazy. But I understood higher necromancy. I have conquered death!

In your madness you inspire pity.

#phrase Firez 14
Oh no! I don't need your pity Joonie! I will kill you now. And then I will revive you and make you my faithful slave. I'll make you kill your foolish baron with your own hands, and I'll crucify his little son, so that he can feel all your romanticism of death firsthand...

Enough! It's time to die, monster!
