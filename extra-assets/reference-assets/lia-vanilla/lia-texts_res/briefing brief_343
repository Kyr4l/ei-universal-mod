Yes, in the cave I found a beautiful armor. Now I'm as ready as ever to fight my worst enemy. Hate will give me extra strength.

It is unbecoming to be driven by such a strong and subversive emotion. Only when the forces of light are on your side, then you will prevail. Do not be confident, after all, for youth is appropriate. Agree: you need help.

Yeah, it's hard to argue with that. The villain has settled into his castle. I can't do without the Baron's forces. But he won't risk attacking the castle. What to do?

Let's ask for help from our... enemies! Everything is unstable in this world, today it's your enemy and tomorrow it will be ready to die for you!

Take this amulet. It will allow you to win over your worst enemy. Like an ogre or a dragon.

That's great! But where do I find them? Ah well, I'll ask Uncle Rada. Thank you, wise Tui-Lena!
