Tyn-Acheiu, I have acquired the material for my axe. Urk-Tar told me that you will make an axe for me to symbolize that I have become a true warrior.

You've proved-you've proved that you're bold if you're not afraid to go into the Dead City-City. You're strong if you brought a good stone. You now-now are a warrior.

And me, I too have followed the stone! The axe is due to me too. It's unfair if Kir gets the axe and Kiel doesn't!

You're the axe-girl. The man-girl axe-topor does not get. You stone little-you brought little.

But Tyn-Achei knows-what to do with your stone-you can do. I'll make you beads, almost like an orc-woman you'll be!
