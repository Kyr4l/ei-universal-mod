Find the robocalls
To take the bodies of the robocallers you must first find the robocallers themselves. The Khadagans are afraid of these subterranean creatures for a reason: killing a robocall is not easy. But it is possible to find some already dead.

This task is not the most enjoyable, but if you don't complete it, the Last Hideout will be in jeopardy.
