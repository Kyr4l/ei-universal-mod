Jygran
Jygran is a world of eternal autumn, a battlefield for two great empires fiercely hostile to each other - Khadagan and Cania. This land is ruled by necrosis and death. It is the result of the terrible spells of the mad necromancer Firiez. From a once flourishing land, evil spells have sucked out almost all the strength: Fields fail to yield, plants die, animals have no young. The population is basically only gathered in the ofortified cities, while the space beyond the reach of the walls is put at the mercy of various creatures and the undead, who can be found there more often than living beings. It is a closed world, lost in time and space.
