The warm rays of joy from meeting you would warm my soul, if only a dark cloud of anxiety did not bedevil my reason.

I just feel like the savior of the forest. I let the dogs out of their cages, I water the trees... I wonder what shook the forest to its foundations this time: a rabbit twisted its paw?

Not far from where people forcibly kept dogs, there is an animal that needs our help. It is frightened and tired.

Well, I get it: you want me to bring this animal to you?

Yes, but it won't be easy. Just as a light breeze plays with a leaf without letting it fall to the ground, so should you push forward the frightened animal in the correct direction.
