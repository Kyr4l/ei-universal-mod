Spells, Schemes, Runes: Buying
When you select spells, runes or prototypes to buy, they will be lined up on the store counter. Its two upper shelves contain the spells, runes or prototypes you wish to purchase, while on the two lower shelves you will find those you wish to sell. In the lower left corner, you will find buttons that you can use to confirm or cancel the transaction.
