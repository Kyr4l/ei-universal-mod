Fieruzie, have you been looking for me? Did something happen?

No, I just missed you. Well of course it happened!!! Otherwise I wouldn't have wasted my time on you! I want to remind you of your debt. You're coming with me. My Aliya got caught by the guards, and now she's in jail. You come with me to get her out.

Come on, dear Fieruz, if there's hot business going on, Kiel has a right to know who he's risking his life for.

Oh hold me!!! A fiancée has turned up at the menacing Fieruz! What, you hid her from us? Were you afraid someone would find out you weren't so scary? That you had a heart?

Kiel, I think you're being rude. Fieruz is in trouble and asks for help and you're laughing.

Thank you boy, you understand me. I can see that you also managed to like some pretty girl. Isn't that our Kiel?

Don't worry about it. Woman! What to do about them... Agreed, also like this: don't go far, we have little time to gather supplies, we need to get going.
