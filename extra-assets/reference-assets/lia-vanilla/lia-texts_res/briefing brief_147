Nice Airy, we have to leave now. And we certainly won't see each other again. I want you to know: I am very happy to have made your acquaintance. I will keep your sight in my heart.

Thank you, I, too, am very glad to be acquainted with you. And I want to remind you again that it might be a good idea to pay attention more often to those who are close to you.

I'm sorry Airy that I attacked you like that back then. You're not the worst kind of girl. And a lot smarter and more attentive than some.

Kiel, if you see the Chosen One at the Great Magician's, give him my regards. Tell him that I still remember him.

I don't think I understand anything I'm hearing. What are you guys talking about? Airy, what have you noticed? What's the situation, Kiel? What are you guys talking about? Did I miss something?
