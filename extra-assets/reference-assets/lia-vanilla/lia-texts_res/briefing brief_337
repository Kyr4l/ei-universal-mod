Not a talisman but an amulet. And so, here it is. Now there is no doubt in my mind that this is what is missing to open the entrance. The amulet was made by an ancient craftsman, Joon.

Joons, Joons... so many stories about them, and all my life I've only seen one of you. And now, it turns out, there's a cave to be found.

There are hardly any of us left. The Joons have passed into history, making way for the young. But they left many mysteries and riddles, and often by guessing one of those riddles you get the answers to the questions that have been bugging you.

Yes, my father also always tells me to study history. That there are answers to many questions locked in it. I'm sure he's right. What do you think?
