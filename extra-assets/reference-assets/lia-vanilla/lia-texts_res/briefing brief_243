Smart guy, look at this - this is the knife I found at the murder scene. Is it familiar to you?

An expensive trinket. I wish I'd seen it before. Do you think that's what killed Brissen?

No doubt.

Poor that knight. He was a strange little fellow, of course. Always sticking his nose in where it didn't belong, sometimes imposing himself out of spite. But to kill... apparently he hurt someone very badly.

Ha, and now I just remembered! Last time I talked to him, he told me that he had tracked down some wicked man who was stealing from his people, the ones who earn for their hard work.... and stuff like that. He generally liked to spread justice everywhere, where it was needed and where it wasn't, so it was said.

Someone is robbing someone.... well it could have been anyone. So now what, we're gonna have to look for the thief?

I don't think it matters. The most important thing is to find the owner of this knife - he's the murderer!
