And where is the leader lost? I look at it this way, some warriors are gone too.

The chieftain for the hunt-hunt is gone. To the mountains to the east. There hunting-hunting good, animals many-many, birds many-many. Long gone, long gone.

Has he been gone a long time? Kir, you know what, I think there's something wrong with this. And Kiel has a nose for such things!

Yeah, you're right. It's strange that the chief hasn't returned from the hunt so far, especially since the terrain there is good and the hunt should be a success.

If you follow the chief, strong-strong the tribe will do well. Tribe-tribe without a chief weak, all may offend him. When Urk-Tar returns it will be at once-at once-good.
