Grey leaf, we found green leaves around the Animal Lords accommodation. I thought it was a sign from you that you wanted to see us.

As a bird that flies from its nest always finds its way home, so your good heart led you to us. A misfortune happened. The good knight Brissen has been found dead!

Thank you, Grey Leaf, for warning me. I must immediately run to the city and rescue the mage. Brissen won't be brought back, but the mage can still be saved.
