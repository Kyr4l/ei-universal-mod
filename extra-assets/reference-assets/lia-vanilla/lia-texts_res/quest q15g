Ambush
The Highwaymen are planning to teach the people of New Village a lesson. Ataman has asked to take part in the venture, as there are very few good warriors left among the highwaymen.

Come to the bridge
The attack on the caravan is to take place as the troop crosses the bridge, which will block the Village warriors' way and they will not be able to help those in need.

Kill them all
The troop from the Village should be killed, otherwise the robbers will find themselves in a no-win situation.
