I enjoyed listening to you. Hold the coins and tell me my fortune. Just please, without your riddles and surprises! Difficulties are enough for me in my life, and my goal has long been set. Tell everything in normal language, and save the riddles for the simpletons.

Who's ever seen a fortune-teller make a simple prediction? My ruby, you listen to the prophecies with your ear, but don't forget to think with your head!
