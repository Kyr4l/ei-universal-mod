Gates of the old pits
After the people abandoned the pits because of the snow tigers sudden appearance there, the governor ordered the cleft which leads to the pits to be blocked. To find them, enter the abandoned mines area, slip past the military camp to the north and go a short distance to the east. The ravine leading south is blocked by the gates.

Finding the hiding place
One of the workers said that during their flight, their supervisors tried to make them carry the last of the nuggets found in the pits, but they revolted and abandoned the nuggets. Surely they still lie somewhere in the southern part of the valleys where the mining occurred.

Take the nugget
The coffer and the cart are not laying here without a reason: probably they've been abandoned by the workers during the flight. You should have a good look at them and take the nugget.

Remains of a gold digger
Obviously someone paid dearly for his attempt to reach the abandoned treasures!

Search the remains
Mayhap you will find something you could put to better use than he did.
