Find the Flower
To find the Flower, you should take the road leading from the Foothills to the east. At first the road goes through the woods, then, to the north, you will see the hills (the broken cart belonging to Babur lies near the first hill). There is a cleft between these hills and if you go a short distance to the north along this cleft, you will find the Flower.
