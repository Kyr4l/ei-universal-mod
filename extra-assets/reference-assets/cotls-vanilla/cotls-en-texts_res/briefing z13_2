So what are you thrusting that rubbish under my nose for? I thought I told you that the Orcs invented their own scribbles! No way to decipher them without a book which their Seers use to teach each other. So, pretty boy, you will have to go to the Orc-land and get yourself an ABC Book there.

Another island, then? If you only knew how sick I am of those islands! Toad's eyes, how boring...

Never mind, dear, never mind. You will not suffer from boredom there, have no fear!

To find the Keeper Seer, you will have to go to the southernmost point of Gipath. We call those lands "Sands", though there is not a lot of actual sand around there.

But what is plentiful there, are all kinds of lovely, sweet creatures. Orcs, Ogres, Lizards... Just the company to cheer up a bored man, he-he-he.

All right, all right, enough jokes for now. Could you be serious for one minute?

Oh, if you want serious, listen carefully... a large promontory enters the lake near those sands. That is where the Keeper Seer's cabin is located. Get the ABC Book from him!
