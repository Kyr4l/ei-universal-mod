Reaching the witch
The witch does not care for uninvited guests, so she laid magic traps on the road to her home. There are two northern ways to the witch's cave: through the western ravine and through the eastern one. The traps in the western ravine are not as strong, but a huge Troll lives there; the Troll in the eastern ravine is younger and less intelligent, but the traps there are more lethal.

Get past the traps
The traps in the western passage only cover particular spots. If you are careful you can bypass them and get to the place where you can find a spare key which controls all the other traps.

Find the traps key
A while ago Craftsman Babur made a spare key for Estera which controls all the traps. This key must be somewhere at the end of the western ravine.

Switch off the lightning traps
Use the key on the magic obelisk to switch off the lightning traps. That will make moving around the place much easier.

Switch off the fire traps
Use the key on the magic obelisk to switch off the fire traps. This will allow you to get close to the obelisk which controls the acid traps.

Switch off the acid traps
Use the key on the magic obelisk to switch off the acid traps. Then the passage through the eastern ravine will be free.

Pass through the Eastern ravine
Now that the acid traps have been switched off, the eastern ravine will offer an easier way to the Witch's cave. But do not be careless: a Troll lives at the end of the ravine and you should try to get past him as stealthily as possible (crawl, mayhap?).
