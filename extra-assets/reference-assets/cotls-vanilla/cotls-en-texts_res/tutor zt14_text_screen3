     You'll be able to apply your "Use/Steal" skill in many different circumstances when using different objects/items, such as opening doors, turning levers, lifting coffer lids etc.
     To use an item place the cursor over the item (the cursor will change shape), and then click.
     Note: your character cannot use every item or object successfully, depending on his Use/Steal skill.
