You must reach the opposite end of the cave. The entrance is to the west, so look for the eastern exit to get as far away as possible from Death Canyon.

Find the lever
Somewhere in the south western part of the cave there must be a lever which lowers the drawbridge across the western lava river. You could also cross that river by the ordinary bridge but that would be much more dangerous.

Switch the lever on
The drawbridge across the western lava river will descend and you will be able to proceed further into the cave.

Explore the Eastern part of the cave
Even if there is no direct way out to the surface here, you should have a good look around the eastern part of the cave, from north to south.
