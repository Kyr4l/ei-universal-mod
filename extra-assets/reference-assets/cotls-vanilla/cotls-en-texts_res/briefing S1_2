I shall be happy to tell the Chosen about the people who live in the village! You already know me, I am Elder Erfar. I have an assistant, a Captain by the name of Gort - a very worthy man. He can be a bit rough but he always carries out my orders to the letter.

And if I give him an order? I am the Chosen, am I not?

Of course you are! But Gort, well he is not very intelligent. He may simply misunderstand you! It is perhaps better if you tell me what you want done, and I will then pass your wishes on to the Captain.

And who helps you with magic?

Ah, that is a sad story, Chosen. A witch named Estera used to live here in the village  - she was an evil, suspicious and quarrelsome old woman. But she left to settle outside the village. And now no one may approach her except for her granddaughter Airy and her apprentice. Those poor girls! When I dwell upon their sufferings at the hand of that evil Harpy, it makes me cry!

The only person who is worse than Estera is Craftsman Babur the Tightfist, a greedy and traitorous man. He offended the Free Hunters, thereby bringing the Goblin raids upon us.

No-no-no, wait a minute, what Hunters were that? And how can Babur be responsible for the Goblin raid?

Free Hunters live in the woods not far from the village. Usually the Goblins strike them first. Recently some of these hunters stole some trinkets from the Craftsman's workshop - nothing serious, just a prank.

But our Tightfist made much ado about nothing, and went to the Hunters to demand his trinkets back! The Chieftain was so upset he did not see the enemy coming and the Goblins raided our village. Thus has our village been on the brink of ruin, and all because of the Craftsman's greed!

I see... Is that all you want to mention?

Practically all. Of course our simple villagers would also be happy to provide assistance to the Chosen, but I do not think their help would be of much value to you!
