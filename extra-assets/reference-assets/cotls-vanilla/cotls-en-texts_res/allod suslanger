Suslanger
Suslanger belongs to the Khadaganian empire. Suslanger's territory is not particularly large, and the lands suitable for living and farming are even smaller. The river which dug a deep canyon flows into the lake; it is really the only significant source of water. To extend the farming lands, people have to build dams and irrigation canals. Khadaganian authorities are cruel and ruthless. Numerous guards punish for even the smallest deviation from Emperor's decrees, while spies and eavesdroppers report on every suspicious person.
