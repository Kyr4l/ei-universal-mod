Simple, ha-ha! I was born here in Suslanger, and in your stinking Gipath I was only interested in one thing...

The meteorite? The same the Khadaganian expedition was on the lookout for?

Ha-ha, you guessed right Chosen! I worked out where that fortune could be found before anyone else! I reached the Portal and travelled to Gipath. Oh, those poor naive villagers... They searched so hard for my meteorite and died... and they did not even know why!
#DESC With theatrical mocking admiration, about villagers- with false pity.

And you... You also were supposed to die but instead you managed to spoil everything for me. You got the upper hand then, but now is the time for revenge!

#phrase Elder  6
I did not lie to you - I really enjoyed telling you how to reach the Portal, and meanwhile the Guards whom I informed about you had just enough time to reach the cave exit. And my ultimate enjoyment will be when I watch you die, oh Great Chosen!
#DESC Exulted

But you still have a chance: fall on your knees and beg for mercy. Mayhap for the sake of the good old days in Gipath I will agree to save your life. But try to convince me with your wails and moans! Well? You may start!
#DESC Still exulted, making the most of his triumph

#phrase Hero  8
You forgot about one thing, Erfar. I have weapons, and even if the whole guard force comes at me, you will be the first one I kill!!!
#DESC Exaggeratedly calm, but we can feel his hate
