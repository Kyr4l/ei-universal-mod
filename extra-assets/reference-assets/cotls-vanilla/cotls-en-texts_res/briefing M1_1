I can see that you are a bit thrifty. If they had stolen your last penny I could understand your anger, but you do not look like a poor man to me!

Well, last penny or not, I still cannot be happy when they steal from me, can I? And secondly, I thought I already explained it. It is not about money, the point is, they stole my bodkin and my chisel!

Well, I am not afraid of toads... all right, Babur, maybe you have not seen the last of your iron toys yet!
