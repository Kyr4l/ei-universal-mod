Green Clan's new place of residence
The Green Clan of the Woodsfolk moved to mountain valleys in the southern part of Karansul's domain. You can only get there through the labyrinth in the hills surrounding the city, there is no other road to the mountain valleys. Humans tell many frightening stories about those valleys: a long time ago there was a warrior Magician who had his laboratory there...that dangerous, evil  magic can still be felt in those parts. Mayhap that is the reason why the Tigers and Trolls who live in those valleys are much stronger than the ones who live in the woods near the city.

Find the altar
The Woodsfolk solved the riddle of the abandoned laboratory and set up an altar which controls the magic traps. The altar is located in the southern part of the valley. It looks like a stump covered with mushrooms. To find it go along the southern wall which encloses the labyrinth. Remember that tigers and Trolls inhabit these parts and are very dangerous. Mayhap you should try to cheat them, not fight them!
