Killing the goblin sentry
A Goblin sentry watches the village constantly and reports all movements to his tribe. This means that the people cannot take their cattle to pasture or send a force against the Goblins. If the sentry sees a soldier he immediately runs away, so the only one who may get close enough to kill him is one who does not resemble a soldier. When the sentry is dead, return to the village - the Foothills is not a good location to walk alone, especially not if only lightly armed!
