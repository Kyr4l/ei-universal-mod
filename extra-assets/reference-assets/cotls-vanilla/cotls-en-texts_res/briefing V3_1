Right, what I propose is to give the Goblins a taste of their own medicine. We will not be able to deal with the whole tribe, but if we skin about seven or eight of them, it would be just the ticket.

And then what?

But the whole village is full of the news that the Chosen wishes to punish the Goblins for their raid.

Is that so?! Where did they get that idea?

The Elder told them so. See, I was about to send my men to deal with it, but if you want to do it - they do not mind, they are not proud. They would be happy to sit at home.

Oh right... I see. And what if I change my mind, eh?

How can you? You are the Chosen, and you only have one word. You will do just as you said you would, won't you?

Yes, I would think so... Well, thanks very much Erfar, and thanks very much to you, Gort. I will remember your kindness.

So we have an agreement then! But one more thing: you better not touch the Orcs, just hit the Goblins. Orcs are much stronger and they have got a Seer in the Foothills - now that is a Magician, not like our Witch!
