Listen, Chosen... Will you take me with you when you go to give the Goblins another thrashing? Or anyone else for that matter, I do not care!

#phrase Merc1  3
I used to be under Gort's command, we were even friends once. But I fell into a bed of mushrooms and gave him a good piece of my mind, y'see. So we do not speak no more and I am not too, err, busy right now...but show me an axe, I show you a warrior! Y'see!

#phrase Merc1  5
My name's Khador, but better call me Rowdy like they all do! So... Think about it, y'see? When it's time to fight, I am your man!
