Find the camp of the guard unit
After you have left the city suburbs and reached the domain of Karansul, go east. Use caution....it is not only the guards who operate in those parts but also the mercenaries of Karansul.

Find the Honorable Elder
The Honorable Elder of the Green Clan Woodsfolk is kept in custody in a cage right in the center of the camp of the guards. The cage is locked and the unit commander has the key.

Find the unit commander
To get the cage key you must find the Commander of the unit - he wears more expensive armor and carries better weapons than those of ordinary guards. If he is not in the camp, you will find him on his rounds of the posts.

Get the key
You cannot open the cage and release the Woodsman without the key held by the unit commander.

To release the Honorable Elder, simply open the cage door.
