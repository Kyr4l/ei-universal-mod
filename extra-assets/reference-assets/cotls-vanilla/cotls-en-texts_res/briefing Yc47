Please, Chief! Tell me about that arrow. I have heard that each of your warriors make special arrows and all are different, so you can always tell the Hunter by his arrows.

How do you know the wolf if not by his tracks? But this arrow never belonged to the Green Clan, though it looks like ours. And another thing: neither the White Clan nor the Black Clan paint their arrows like that.

Those clans may be my enemies but we defeat enemies by force of weapons, not by lies.

And I had hoped to learn something from you... so I suppose I should continue my quest in the city.

I am sorry if it is so. But no one can say that our people do not know gratitude! We will go east by the secret path, but the path will be open to you.

Go east from here, open the gates and enter the labyrinth between the hills. Go through that labyrinth, open another gate and enter the mountain valleys. A long time ago people lived there - Magicians who invented new spells for wars, but they have long since abandoned the area. But as the flood leaves dirt and litter where the water flowed, they left ruins and traces of their deadly magic in those mountain valleys.

But the Green Clan managed to control that magic and make good use of it. Go along the southern wall of the valleys and use our altar: the magic trap will keep off the savage tigers so you can proceed southeast, to the new place of residence of the Green Clan.

Thank you Grey Leaf! If I need the Green Clan's help I will know where to find you. And now goodbye - I have to return to the city and continue my quest there!
