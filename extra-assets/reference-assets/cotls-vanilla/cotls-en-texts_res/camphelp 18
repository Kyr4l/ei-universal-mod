Spells, keystones, runes: selling
When you choose spells, keystones or runes to buy in the shop, they will be put on the counter. The two top shelves of the counter hold the spells, keystones and runes you are buying, while the two bottom shelves hold the ones you are selling. Use the buttons at the lower left-hand corner of the counter to confirm or cancel the transaction (whether buying or selling).
