     Your blows will cause much greater damage if you can catch your enemy unawares and strike him. To perform a "backstab" your character must get close to the enemy from the behind without him noticing (its best to use the "Sneak" mode so the enemy won't hear you), and then strike him before he realizes what's happening.

     If your enemy notices you approaching and switches to Aggressive mode, your blow will not be counted as a "backstab". So be sneaky!
