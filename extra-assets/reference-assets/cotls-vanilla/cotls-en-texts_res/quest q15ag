Big Shell
Lizards have a symbol of peace - the Big Shell. According to custom, the Lizard tribe which has the Big Shell on its altar do not attack humans and fight only when attacked. At present, the Big Shell is on the altar in the Remote Mountains. You must go there and get it. To reach this location, take the road which runs from west to east through the Middle Mountains.
