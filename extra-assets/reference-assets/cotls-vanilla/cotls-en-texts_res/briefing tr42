They say, lad, that you are trying to find Princess? Well, why not do it yourself then? My name's merchant Karansul, not Help All. I sell good stuff for good money and I do not care about anything else.

All right, that is good enough... but suppose I wanted to buy something magical, where would I go? You may be a good merchant but you do not look like a Magician!

Appearances can be deceptive. I control all trade in this city. So I sell runes as well. And never mind who makes them for me. I do not pay Magician Diera for nothing, do I?
