Seems clear enough to me. Them are them... "Free Hunters", that is what we are supposed to call them now. Ah, the Elder says they are our friends, but they have robbed me! My apprentice saw them and tried to stop them - so they gave him such a thrashing, the poor wee laddie could not work for two days!
