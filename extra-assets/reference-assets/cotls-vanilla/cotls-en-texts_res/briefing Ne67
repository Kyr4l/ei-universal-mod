Taivo? A young talentless copycat who never created a single spell in his whole life! But he managed to have old Kholai removed from the imperial laboratory, so now he is Chief Imperial Necromancer. I suppose that old plotter Kholai did deserve to be taught a lesson, but I should have been appointed to his office, not that scum Taivo!

I wonder if the old man has anything good to say about anyone at all? Come on, there are more important things than that.

So probably Kholai would like to play some kind of dirty trick on Taivo?

You can wager on it! If I know old Kholai, and I know him well, he never sleeps in that tower of his, but sits and thinks constantly of revenge!

Will he break the law for the sake of revenge?

Kholai has done a lot of dirty things in his life. Flatter him, and he will do anything for you! You will find him in the tower in the northeastern part of the desert - Kholai has been evicted from the Necromancers' guarded village.

Without any protection?

Oh yes, he-he, he does have protection, and very good protection too. Only it is there not to make sure Kholai is all right, oh no! The guards make sure the old man cannot see anyone without the Guild's approval.
