I know nothing about the Middle Mountains - I have no business there. Better ask your friend the Craftsman, he always goes there for stones. Mind you, Babur means nothing to me... as far as I am concerned the Lizards can devour him alive... but they do not bother him at all - 'tis as if he were charmed!

Uh-huh... so do you know where he goes for his stones?

No. Why?

I think it is time to play a little joke on the Craftsman - just to show him he should not be so greedy.

In that case I do know where he gets his stones. You see, Babur is a suspicious character, so I told someone to follow him. Babur went right into the Middle Mountains, took the road east and did not leave it until he reached the Remote Mountains. There is a rather weird place there: four pillars with a fire burning on top of each.

I do not know who put those pillars there, but they make a good landmark. The Lizards' altar with a large Shell on top lies to the north of the pillars.  And Babur's quarry is further to the north. So there!
