Does he joke? They are about to torture me and he asks if I want to escape!

I give my word that I will come to you. Well? Will you free me now?

You will find my home to the northwest of the area you call the Sands. To get there you must cross the lands where Dead City is located from north to south, then enter the Sands from there. Did you memorize all that?

Yes. I hope I do not have to enter the city itself?

#phrase OLIZ  9
No. You go from north to south and enter the Sands. Go to the northwest of that area. Before you reach my home you will see a ring of water and an island. On the island there are stone pillars. This is a trap. I will give you the Ancient Claw with which you can probably control the trap.

Hey, wait a minute! What do you mean "probably"? Are you saying I can fail? And what would happen then?
#CAMERA 5
#phrase OLIZ  11
Then I will not be able to talk to you. It would be better if you get pass the trap. Do you not agree?

Hey, no argument... and now give me your claw and let me out of here at last!
