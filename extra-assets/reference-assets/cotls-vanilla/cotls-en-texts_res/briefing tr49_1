All right, you wanted to meet Baldie, here you are. Just do not forget about the tale!

You better ask where I got that case with Valrasian's crest on it. Be still, it is empty anyway and the stuff is in a safe place! So you have got a very simple choice: either you talk to me or I call the Guards and you talk to Captain Tilvar.

Not "how much" but "what". Tell me how the arrow from this case found its way into the Snoop's body? And take my advice, no lies.

Well, they showed me that Snoop, yeh, and told me to make a corpse outta him, but to putta blame on the Woodsfolk. So I done him in, yeh? And I stick an arrow in him. It was my own idea where to get one. No way I wanna annoy those Woodsfolk, so I nicked it from the Guvnor. Dead easy it was and that Big Grey knew how to bypass the magic traps.

What Big Grey?

A newcomer. Never saw him myself. Comes to talk all wrapped up in a cloak'n'hood - can see nothin', not even his snout! And talks funny too, mumbles in a weird voice. Afraid to be recognized, I reckon.

Methinks the Snoop and the Woodsfolk found out something about him and he did not like that. The Snoop almost found the Princess, for sure. And what was it about the Woodsfolk - beats me, maybe they saw how the Big Grey changed his clothes?

Aha, the Woodsfolk again! I must take the "secret path" to their new shelter... mayhap I can find out what they know about that man in grey.

I should have asked them before... but how could I, I only just learned about that Grey person?!
