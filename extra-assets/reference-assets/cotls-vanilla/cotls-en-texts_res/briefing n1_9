Eh... Esteemed Knight! I would be happy to accept your company but... sometimes I have to resort to... well... not very honest methods and I do not know how you might react, if you understand what I mean...

When I say I serve good that certainly does not mean that I am a wilting flower with white gloves. All is fair in war, even if it is a war between good and the evil. I swear I will go everywhere with you and will do everything necessary!

Yes, but occasionally I will have to go to the city!

Oh, do not fret about that. There is no one left within the city walls who would remember my face!
