I found the body of a man, and it looks like it was Snoop. Look how he was killed...

Oh dear! Woodsfolk shoot such arrows out of their tubes! And you can always tell whose arrow it was - each tribe has its own colors and signs!

What Woodsfolk? We never heard of them where I come from!

You live and learn, boy! I thought they were known throughout Ingos, but apparently that is not so. Briefly, they are tiny humans who live in the woods. I often see them and I even know some of them. I will tell you more about them later if you wish, just ask me.

I will not. Meanwhile could you tell me about this arrow and which tribe it belongs to?

I cannot read the signs on arrows, that is the problem! Only the Woodsfolk can help you there. But I will tell you who can help.

Captain Tilvar has been looking for an excuse to subdue the Woodsfolk for a long time now and now you find a man killed by one of their arrows. The Guards would definitely go for a punitive expedition! So it would be in the Woodsfolks' best interests to find out which tribe is responsible.

You mean I should go to them and somehow make them talk to me? Is that possible?

Yes it is, but you will have to risk your hide to do it, sonny. You see, there are several Woodsfolk clans with permanent feuds going on between them. For example the White Clan recently kidnapped the Keeper of the Green Clan and now they hold him captive.

You see, each Clan has its own Sacred Flower, to them like banners are to our army. And Keepers look after these flowers. So if you free the Keeper of the Green Clan, he will give you the Sacred Flower to bring to the Clan. After that their Chief will just have to talk to you!

Excellent! Tell me where I can find the Keeper!

Listen carefully, sonny. After you leave the city go west across the lake. When you find the prison where the Keeper is held, do not forget to switch off the trap - first! The White Clan Seer has an evergreen leaf - take it and place on the altar in front of the prison. I mean, the Woodsfolk call it an altar but it looks more like a rotten stump covered with mushrooms to me.

And after you get the Sacred Flower go to the Green Clan! The road there is not difficult: go south from the city and you will find it. Their Chief is called Grey Leaf, I know him.
