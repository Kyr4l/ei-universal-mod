Ho friend! I noticed you a long time ago: you really are a great marksman. What would you say if I offered you a chance to hit more interesting targets? For example the ghouls who always get in my way during my expeditions?

They do not call me Archer for nothing. My arrows do not like to lie idly in their quiver. But I cannot go just like that. I report to the Captain.

I see. But still, I would like you to consider my proposition!
