I am afraid, Witch, your dream was true after all: I found the Goblin camp and there was a stockade there, but no granddaughter.

Oh dear, do not ever scare me like that again! So she is not being held by the Goblins, that is just fine, and I do not need any dreams to feel that she is alive.

Do not yet think everything is fine! Here is what I found in that hole...

Oh... That is my vial, I filled it with potion myself... so what do we do now, eh? Curse you, Chosen, think!

Have a close look at the vial... did you attach that piece of paper to it? Of course I have a very high opinion of your skills, but I do not think you would use Orc language for your notes!

Well, give me a look... Aha! It says that an Orc called Shei-Var allowed them to keep the vial. So he took my girl to their settlement?! I will scratch that Shei-Var's eyes out for him, you just watch me!

Hold, hold. Since this is apparently my fault, I must sort it out. Do you know where this Shei-Var lives?

I have heard of Shei-Var... he is Chief of a small but strong Orc tribe which is called simply "Sheivar tribe". Until now they never offended humans, so I cannot think what he wants Airy for.

Please, would you go to him? If that Shei-Var starts to bargain, do not argue, just get my dear, headstrong granddaughter back!

The Sheivars' settlement is easy to find, just enter the Sands from the Dead City side and then travel due south. There will be a drawbridge and next to it is the Orc caretaker's hut.

You take the mechanism from the caretaker, lower the bridge, cross the river and you are almost in Shei-Var's house. Just use your wits when you talk to him, and do not be mean if it comes to paying ransom. I will pay you everything back, with interest!
