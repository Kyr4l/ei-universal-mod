Right, Chosen, meet this lazy girl - she is my apprentice, Naya's her name. You see dear, I thought that you could do with a bit of help although you are the Chosen, mighty and wise - all right, eh?

What an old crow! She knows very well I am no Chosen but still she needles me!

Did I say I would go with you anywhere? I am not of the age to run backwards and forwards across the woods! But Naya would go with you, even into an Orcs' lair if need be! And it will be a fine test for her - we will see how well she has learned my lessons.
