Come to the Lizards
The tribe which has the treasure lives on the sand banks down to the south.

Escape from the Lizards
The welcome the Lizards extended took a somewhat peculiar form - it seems they like their visitors to stay with them, but not necessarily alive! You must leave this tribe as soon as possible to escape their dangerous hospitality. Mayhap you can rekindle a long-standing feud between Lizards and Orcs....lure the Lizards who pursue you to the area farther east inhabited by Orcs. Then the sparks will fly!
