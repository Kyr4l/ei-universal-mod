If the raven takes a hawk's booty, what is left for the hawk? Only to take his revenge upon the raven! If one man offends us mortally, another man will take revenge on the offender.

Go to the land of abandoned mines from the city suburbs and walk a short distance to the east. You will see a military camp between the two hills and soldiers who are training to kill. The spy among them is like a tiger among rats, you cannot miss him. You will do a good deed if you avenge the spy who kidnapped Habbura!

It seems to me that lately I have done nothing but good deeds. But somehow they all end with someone being killed by me. I am neither faint-hearted, nor am I a hired killer!

The Hunter kills the tiger and sells its skin. Does that mean that the tiger was a harmless kitten? A Friend of the Green Clan avenges Habbura's kidnapping. Does that mean that the dead kidnapper was an innocent victim? Think about that, human!
