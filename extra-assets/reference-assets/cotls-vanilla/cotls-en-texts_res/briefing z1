Hey lad! How did you manage to get in here? And what you want, eh? Get out before I make raw meat of you!

Well, if you are not interested in a Magic Bit at all, I will go then!

Ho there, not so fast... Oh dear, we are impatient! Stop, will you? Of course I am interested in it! I suppose I might work up some enthusiasm even for an invited guest who brought me a gift like that.

And by the way... who are you? I do not recognize you, are you not from the village?

Be advised, oh Witch Estera, that I am the Chosen! I have been sent by divine forces to protect the people of Gipath!

Toad's breath, we are proud, are we not? Do not try to cheat me! And do not tell me those fables about the Chosen one, I can see right into your soul. Be quiet, now! A very long way lies ahead of you, pretty boy, there is a lot of grief on your mind, and in your past... in your past... well, knock me down with a feather...I cannot see what was in your past!

Well, I do not know my past either. I just cannot seem to remember it?

Well, thank you very much, that is a relief. I thought that mayhap my age had caught up with me and it was time for me to die.

Oh come on, you are not old at all! I would say you are in the prime of life!

I know that you lie, but such lies are still music to my old ears. And you are a nice lad, polite and handsome, nothing like those oafs from the village. You are welcome to drop by any time, I will be happy to see you...

I wonder why I am being so kind today, eh? It will probably rain soon!
