Orc ABC Book
The witch cannot translate the note addressed to the traitors. To do that she will need the Orcs ABC-book which the Seer carries with him. The best way to reach his home is to go to the "Sands" through the "River and Islands".

Find the home of the seer
There is a large promontory which goes from west to south-east, far into the lake bordering the sands. Near the end of that promontory is a small barren islet which can be reached by foot. A hut is on that islet and the seer who owns the ABC book lives there. The road to the end of the promontory will indeed be dangerous - it is guarded by Orcs, and a savage Ogre also lives somewhere near.

Kill the Seer
There is only one way to ensure that the seer does not raise the alarm - kill him.

Take the ABC book
The Orc ABC book is the main objective of this quest. Without it, the witch cannot read the note.
