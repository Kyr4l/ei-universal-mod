No wonder you young man cannot be found...it is harder to find a live Joon than to buy a tame Harpy. We in Khadagan have scientists - no good lazy slouches to whom the Emperor pays good money. In return they pretend to study the heritage of that race. Perchance you should look in that direction.

Oh yes, and about the Harpies... you seem to be an enterprising and greedy young man...

Greedy? Are you trying to insult me?

No, no, of course not. You are still young and cannot see the underlying reasons for peoples' actions, even your own. They say "kindness, nobility and honor...", I hear only "greed, vengeance and cruelty". These qualities are really what make people tick.

So I want to throw some business your way. Before I was disgraced, I carried out experiments on Harpies and I do not want any others to claim the credit... Oh, those wicked two-faced plotters!

The Harpy I experimented with lives in the southwestern part of the Necromancers' desert. Destroy it and I will reward you handsomely. My vengeance combined with your greed will be the cause of an evil creature's death... many would call that a good deed, would they not? Ha-ha-ha!

Now do you see that I do know the real reason for everything which happens in the world?

Mmm, yes, that old man really knows how to reason... but I will be damned if I ever believe in such logic!
